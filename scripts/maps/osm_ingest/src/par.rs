//! Deterministic parallel map over contiguous chunks of a slice.
//!
//! Chunks are claimed dynamically (so a heavy chunk doesn't stall a core) but
//! each chunk's result is stored at its own index, so merging the results in
//! index order gives output that does not depend on thread scheduling. Every
//! parallel stage in this crate is built on that property — it is what makes the
//! tool reproducible, which the C++ generator it replaces was not.
//!
//! The pool size is capped by [`set_threads`] (`--threads`) or `MAPS_THREADS`,
//! because the build scripts run several of these tools concurrently and an
//! uncapped pool oversubscribes the box once they do.
