//! A streaming reader for the one shapefile this project reads.
//!
//! # Why write this rather than shell out
//!
//! The OSMCoastline land polygons ship as an ESRI shapefile, and converting one normally means GDAL.
//! This repository has spent its whole life removing that class of dependency — osmium, tippecanoe
//! and Planetiler are all gone — and a polygon shapefile is a genuinely simple binary format: a
//! 100-byte header, then length-prefixed records of `f64` pairs. Reading it directly is about a
//! hundred lines, needs no toolchain, and streams, which matters when the file is 1.26 GB and the
//! whole point of the change it serves is to stop holding geometry in memory.
//!
//! Only what is needed is implemented: shape type 5, `Polygon`. A `PolygonZ` or a `PolyLine` in this
//! file would mean the wrong artefact was handed over, so those are refused rather than coerced.
//!
//! # Ring orientation is the opposite of GeoJSON's
//!
//! The ESRI specification orders an outer ring **clockwise** and a hole counter-clockwise — the
//! reverse of GeoJSON and of this pipeline. That does not matter for winding, because stage C
//! normalises it. It matters for **grouping**: a record holds a flat list of rings, and knowing which
//! are exteriors is the only way to tell one island with a lake from two separate islands.
