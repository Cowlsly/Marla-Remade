//! Turning many observations of a beacon into at most one store record.
//!
//! This is where "accuracy first" is actually earned. Coverage comes from the crawl; what
//! decides whether a fix is any good is which observations are kept and which are thrown away.
//!
//! Three rules, in order of how much they matter:
//!
//! 1. **Movers are dropped entirely.** A BSSID seen in two places kilometres apart is a phone
//!    hotspot, a travel router, or an AP on a bus or train. Recording either position is worse
//!    than recording none: a device that sees it gets confidently placed somewhere it is not,
//!    and the solver has no way to tell. This is also the standard privacy mitigation for a
//!    dataset of this shape, since a moving AP's history is a person's history.
//! 2. **Unusable identifiers are dropped**: randomized or multicast MACs, cell identities that
//!    do not fit the key layout, coordinates outside the representable range.
//! 3. **Among what is left, the most precise observation wins**, and its accuracy is carried
//!    into the store rather than being replaced by a constant.
