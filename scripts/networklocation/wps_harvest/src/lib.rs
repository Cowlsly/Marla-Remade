//! Build the offline WiFi and cell beacon stores that `:networklocation` reads.
//!
//! Three stages, one binary each:
//!
//! | Binary | Does |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `wps_seed` | Open bulk dumps (beacondb, OpenCelliD) -> record shards |
//! | `wps_crawl` | Apple gs-loc snowball -> record shards, resumably |
//! | `wps_build` | Shards -> a sorted, filtered, deduplicated `WPSDB2` store |
//!
//! The stages are separate processes because they have nothing in common operationally: a
//! seed ingest is minutes, a planet crawl is weeks, and a build is hours of IO. Passing record
//! shards between them means a crawl can be interrupted, resumed, extended, or merged with a
//! newer dump without any stage knowing about the others.
//!
//! ## Where the accuracy comes from
//!
//! The store this writes keeps each beacon's coordinates as integer degrees x 1e8 — bit-exact
//! against what the source reported — and its own horizontal accuracy. The format it replaces
//! quantized to a 20 m grid and carried no accuracy at all, so the device substituted one
//! constant for every beacon and the solver's uncertainty weighting, which is fully
//! implemented, had nothing to work with.
