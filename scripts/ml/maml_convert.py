"""ONNX to `.maml`, the weights container `:library:ml` reads.

`:library:ml` is not a graph interpreter: each network's forward pass is hardcoded
Rust in `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/nets/`. So a `.maml` file carries **only
ordered tensors** — no operators, no topology, no names. The Rust net module
indexes the tensor table positionally.

That makes tensor *order* the entire contract between this script and the Rust,
and a reordering would be silently wrong rather than a load failure. So the order
is defined mechanically and pinned:

* Order is the weighted nodes in ONNX **topological order** — `Conv`/`ConvTranspose`
  weight then bias, `PRelu` slope, `Gemm` weight then bias. Nothing else is emitted:
  every other initializer in these graphs is shape-computation scaffolding that folds
  away at a fixed input size.

  Topological rather than initializer order matters for the nets with `PRelu`: the Rust
  reads a layer as `weight = i, bias = i + 1, slope = i + 2`, which only lines up if a
  slope is emitted immediately after the convolution it follows.
* `--check` hashes the whole ordered layer table (shapes *and* the attributes the
  Rust hardcodes: dilation, pads, strides, group) into one SHA-256 pinned below.
  Any upstream re-export that renames, reorders, retunes or re-pads a single layer
  changes that hash and fails, instead of producing a file that loads and infers
  nonsense.

Two nodes are rewritten rather than emitted verbatim, because doing it here means the
runtime needs no shader for either:

* A **`Gemm`** over a flattened NCHW map is a convolution whose kernel covers the whole
  spatial extent. MobileFaceNet's `[512, 3136]` becomes `[512, 64, 7, 7]` and the
  existing `conv.comp` computes it, so there is no `InnerProduct` pipeline.
* A trailing **`BatchNormalization`** is folded into the `Gemm` before it. At inference a
  batch norm is a per-channel affine, so `W' = W * gamma / sqrt(var + eps)` and
  `b' = (b - mean) * gamma / sqrt(var + eps) + beta` is exact, not an approximation.

Weights are stored fp16 with fp32 accumulation in-shader (see `SPEC` below for the
byte layout). ONNX tensor layout is preserved verbatim — `[M, C/group, kH, kW]` for
`Conv`, `[C, M/group, kH, kW]` for `ConvTranspose` — so nothing here has to agree
with the shaders about a transpose.

One graph does not come from an ONNX export at all. SMaLL-100 is read from its PyTorch
`.safetensors` and quantised to int8 here, because the only ONNX exports that exist for it are
already int8 and quantised per *tensor*; see [`CHECKPOINTS`] for why that is not usable.

One graph is an ONNX export whose tensor table is nevertheless **derived from architecture
constants and read by name**, rather than walked topologically. TinyCLIP is two towers in one
graph, interleaved, and its projections are anonymous `onnx::MatMul_NNNN` initializers, so a
topological walk would emit an order no one could read. See [`ARCHITECTURES`].

#
# One entry, TinyCLIP. Three things make the walk unusable for it:
#
# * It is **two towers in one graph**, and the export interleaves them - text layer 0, vision layer
#   0, text layer 1, and so on. A topological order is therefore an order no reader could check
#   against `nets::tinyclip`, and `Mode::Image` and `Mode::Text` would each read a stride through
#   the table.
# * Every projection is a bare `MatMul` against an **anonymous** `onnx::MatMul_NNNN` initializer.
#   There is nothing in the initializer's name to say which layer or which projection it is. The
#   *node* names are fully structured (`/vision_model/encoder/layers.3/mlp/fc1/MatMul`), so this
#   reads the weight through the node, which is also what makes the inventory check below possible.
# * `MatMul` is `x @ W` with a **`[in, out]`** weight, and this runtime indexes a kernel as
#   `[out, in, kh, kw]`. Every attention projection here is square 256 x 256, so reading one
#   convention as the other yields a tensor of exactly the right shape holding exactly the wrong
#   numbers. `fc1` is `[256, 1024]` and `fc2` is `[1024, 256]`, so the shape assertions in
#   [`check_architecture`] are what make that loud.
#
# The `Conv` is the one exception and needs **no** transpose: ONNX `Conv` is already
# `[M, C, kH, kW]`, which is this runtime's own layout.
#
# What is checked is the **exact named-parameter inventory** derived from these constants, as
# [`CHECKPOINTS`] gets, *plus* the op counts in [`EXPECTED_OPS`] that only an ONNX graph can give.

# Graphs read from a **PyTorch checkpoint** rather than an ONNX graph, keyed by graph id name.
#
# Every other net here converts from a frozen ONNX export, and for good reason: the graph records
# the shapes and the op inventory, so `check_graph` can refuse an export whose structure moved
# without anyone transcribing anything. A checkpoint has neither. It is used anyway for SMaLL-100,
# because the only ONNX exports that exist for it are already int8:
#
# * `casawolice/small100-onnx` quantises **per tensor**, not per output channel. Its embedding's
#   row absmax spans 0.258 to 1.740, so one scale for the whole table costs a factor of four in
#   resolution against the per-row scale `quantise_per_channel` produces, and up to 6.7x on the
#   quietest rows. That resolution cannot be recovered by requantising: it is already gone.
# * It carries the 131M-parameter embedding **three times** - `embed_tokens.weight` in the
#   encoder, `model.shared.weight` in the decoder and a separately quantised `[1024, 128112]`
#   `lm_head` - which is why that deployment set is 609 MB rather than 333 MB. In the checkpoint
#   the weight is tied and appears exactly once, so the tied head costs nothing.
# * Its two embedding copies are **uint8 with a zero point of 159**. `conv_point_int8.comp`
#   computes `scale[o] * sum(int8_w * in)` and has nowhere to put a zero point.
#
# What is checked instead is the **exact parameter inventory** - every name and every shape,
# derived from the constants below rather than listed - which is a stricter guard than the op
# counts an ONNX graph gets, because it fails on a renamed or resized parameter as well as on a
# missing one. The layer table digest still covers the order.

    #   its kernel, so four zeros per block are synthesised and recorded in the digest key.

    #   the collector splits it into three in that order, which is
    #   `_in_projection_packed`'s.

    #   an architecture change, not a detail, and fails here.
    # * **A shared attention-bias weight.** `smolgen_shared_weight` `[4096, 64]` is one
    #   parameter registered under nine names — itself plus
    #   `transformer.layers.N.self_attn.smolgen_weight` for all eight blocks, all aliasing
    #   the same storage. `fetch_maia.py` asserts that and drops the eight extras, so this

    wants a second copy. `nets::small100` gathers row `t` of it on the host to build the encoder
    and decoder inputs - the rows are contiguous, and each carries its own scale, which is exactly
    what a per-output-channel quantiser produces - and binds the same tensors as the kernel of the

    * `sqrt(d_model)` is **not** folded into the embedding here, unlike the fp16 `Gather` arm in

      fewer than scaling an int8 code by its scale and then by `sqrt(1024)`.
    * The attention query scale is **not** folded into `q_proj`. M2M-100 scales the query by
      `head_dim ** -0.5` and `head_dim` is 64, which is the `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` `attn_scores`
      already applies. Folding it would apply it twice.
    * Sinusoidal positions are not in the checkpoint and are not emitted. They are static, so
      `nets::small100` computes them and adds them to the gathered rows in fp32, which also

        the tied head, the decoder position table, each decoder layer, the decoder's norm

    # The two convolutions

    Both are rank-3 in the checkpoint and are emitted as the `1 x k` rank-4 kernel this runtime
    indexes, which is a reshape of the same bytes. Their geometry is in the digest key rather than in
    the Rust alone, because `conv2`'s **stride 2** is what turns 3000 mel frames into 1500 encoder
    positions and a wrong stride gives the right rank and the wrong length.

    # The absent key bias

    No `k_proj` in any of the 18 attentions has one. `Builder::conv_int8` reads a bias after the
    scale, so each gets zeros — exact, and recorded in the digest key as `b0=synthesised` so a
    checkpoint that grows one is not silently read as this table.

    # The tied head

    `model.decoder.embed_tokens.weight` is emitted **once** and has two roles, as SMaLL-100's does:
    `nets::whisper` gathers a row of it on the host to build a decode step's input, and binds the
    same tensor as the kernel of the logits projection. At 51,865 x 512 it is 26.6 MB of int8, well
    inside `maxStorageBufferRange`'s guaranteed 128 MiB, so unlike SMaLL-100 it needs no class split.

    # What is not folded

    * The attention query scale. Whisper scales the query by `head_dim ** -0.5` and `head_dim` is 64,
      which is the `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` `attn_scores` already applies. Folding it would apply it
      twice.
    * `sqrt(d_model)` on the embedding. `config.json` has `scale_embedding: false`, so there is none.
    * Both **position tables** are real tensors, and they go opposite ways. The **encoder's** is
      added to the conv stem's output, which is a device tensor, so it is transposed to
      `[width, 1, positions]` and emitted as a `Kind::Constant`. The **decoder's** is added to a
      gathered embedding row on the *host*, in f32, exactly as `nets::small100::embed_positions`
      does, so it stays `[positions, width]` and never reaches a shader.

        3. the final norm (1). Tensor 16.
        4. each layer 0..34, in the order `declare_layer` states. A layer that owns a cache
           contributes 32 tensors; one that does not contributes 25.

    # Two things the converter does that the export does not

    * **Transposes** every projection. The export holds `MatMul` weights as `[in, out]`; every
      convolution in this runtime takes an ONNX `Conv` kernel, `[out, in, kh, kw]`.
    * **Synthesises a zero bias** for each. Gemma 4 has none - `attention_bias` is false - but a
      convolution here always takes one, and a zero bias is `out * 2` bytes against a kernel of
      `out * 1536`.

    # And two it deliberately does not

    * `layer_scalar` is emitted **unchanged**, not folded. Folding it into
      `per_layer_projection`'s weights would be exact and would save an op, but the per-layer
      branch is the one part of the forward pass with no reference run behind it; folding a
      constant into a path whose shape is still unconfirmed makes the eventual comparison harder,
      not easier. `nets::gemma4` names it as a host tensor meanwhile.
    * The **scale folded into `q_norm`** stays folded. The export applies no `1/sqrt(head_dim)`
      between the query projection and the score matmul, and `nets::gemma4` passes a scale of one
      to match - see `Q_NORM_CARRIES_SCALE`. Dividing it out here would need the Rust to stop
      doing that in the same commit.

    The anchor is that the nodes themselves are numbered in topological order:
    `node_linear`, `node_linear_1` .. `node_linear_113`, and
    `_fused_rms_norm/node_mean` .. `node_mean_112`. Seven linears and seven norms a layer, over
    sixteen layers, plus a patch projection and an output projection at the ends - which is
    checked below rather than assumed, because a renumbering upstream would otherwise shift every
    tensor silently.

    Clips are taken by graph position between one layer's first norm and the next's: eleven a
    layer, and one before the first layer for the patch projection. Also checked.

    Every weight is called `val_2567` or `permute_9` or `_to_copy_16`, so matching by name is
    impossible for most of them. HOW EACH FAMILY IS FOUND, weakest tier last:

        depthwise convs, SSCP convs   ATTRIBUTE: group == 1024 / group == 1, plus asserted
                                      pads and strides. Export-independent.
        relative tables               SHAPE [8, 128, 13] and consumed by a MatMul.
        folded query scales           SHAPE [128] and consumed by a Mul. The first SSCP layer
                                      norm's gain is also [128] but is consumed by a
                                      LayerNormalization, so the op type separates them.
        SSCP norm gains               op type LayerNormalization - the only two in the tower.
        linears, RMS norms, clips     NODE NUMBERING, the fragile tier.

    NAMES ARE THE LAST RESORT AND THE LAST TIER IS GUARDED ACCORDINGLY. Neither namespace is
    stable across exports: the fp16 cast renumbers every `node_<Op>_<N>` and renames 44% of the
    initializers (618 in each export, only 345 in common), so a name-based collector calibrated
    on `audio_encoder.onnx` finds different tensors in `audio_encoder_fp16.onnx`. Counts alone
    do not catch a reordering that preserves the count, so the numbered families additionally
    assert the SHAPE of all ten linear slots in all twelve layers, and that every layer's
    eighteen clips are consumed by the same sequence of op types as layer 0's. A shift that
    survived all of that would have to preserve every shape at every slot, which the layer's
    [1024, 4096] / [4096, 1024] / [1024, 2048] mix does not allow.

    # The hole in the linear numbering

    `node_linear` runs 0..134 but **thirteen indices are absent**. Twelve of them are
    `relative_k_proj`, one per layer, which the exporter constant-folded into the `[8, 128, 13]`
    table this collects separately: the sinusoid it projects depends on nothing but dtype, so
    there is nothing left to compute at runtime and no `MatMul` is emitted. The thirteenth is
    133, because `output_proj` is the one linear with a bias and the exporter split it - the
    `MatMul` is named something else entirely and `node_linear_133` is the `Add`.

    Index 0 is PRESENT and is the input projection. It is the bare `node_linear` with no
    numeric suffix, which `numbered` maps to 0; a reader that only matches `node_linear_<N>`
    misses it, concludes the range starts at 1, and is then off by one for the whole graph.

    So the stride is **11 with a hole at +5**, not 10. A naive `1 + 10 * i` is off by one from
    layer 0 onward and lands on plausible-looking shapes all the way down; both the hole and the
    count are asserted below rather than assumed.

        and an input index of `m * 32 + c`. `nets::gemma4_audio` carries the map as
        `[ch, mel, time]` so that the flatten into a `[1024, 1, T]` sequence is a relabelling of
        the same bytes rather than a copy of a 23 MB activation - and that ordering is
        `c * 32 + m`.

        Permuting a `[1024, 1024]` weight once here is free. Transposing the map at runtime, per
        clip, is not. Both sides say so: see `nets::gemma4_audio::INPUT_PROJECTION`.

           synthesised zero bias [rows]. Op "Head". Tensors 0..11.
        2. each encoder layer 0..11 in forward order. Per layer, in this exact order:
           self_attn_layer_norm (LayerNorm, 2 tensors: gamma, beta),
           self_attn q/k/v/out_proj (Linear8, 3 tensors each: kernel, scale, bias),
           final_layer_norm (LayerNorm, 2),
           fc1 (Linear8, 3), fc2 (Linear8, 3).
           22 tensors per encoder layer.
        3. the encoder's final layer norm (LayerNorm, 2 tensors).
        4. each decoder layer 0..11 in forward order. Per layer: self_attn block as in
           the encoder (2 + 4*3 = 14 tensors), then encoder_attn_layer_norm (2) +
           encoder_attn q/k/v/out_proj (4*3 = 12), then final_layer_norm (2) + fc1/fc2
           (2*3 = 6). 36 tensors per decoder layer.
        5. the decoder's final layer norm (LayerNorm, 2 tensors). Last.

    and biases.

    # What is folded, and what is not (same as small100 — same M2M-100 forward pass)

    * `sqrt(d_model)` is **not** folded into the embedding. The host gather applies it in
      fp32 (`embed_positions`), one rounding fewer than scaling int8 codes.
    * The attention query scale is **not** folded into `q_proj`. M2M-100 scales the query
      by `head_dim ** -0.5` (head_dim 64) = the `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` `attn_scores` applies.
    * Sinusoidal positions are not in the checkpoint and are not emitted. `nets::nllb600`
      computes fairseq's concatenated-halves sinusoid at position `past + at + 1 + 1`
      (padding_idx 1, so first token sits at 2) — byte-identical math to small100.
    * FFN activation is **ReLU** (`activation_function: relu` in config.json), so the Rust
      uses `Act::Relu` on fc1, not GELU.
    * The four checkpoint copies of the tied embedding are asserted byte-identical in

        5.  smolgen kernel replicated  int8 [32768, 64, 1, 1] + scale [32768] + zero bias
        8.  each block 0..7 in forward order, 30 tensors each, in this exact order:
              sm2 (Linear8, 3), ln1 (LayerNorm, 2), sm3 (Linear8, 3), ln2 (LayerNorm, 2),
              q / k / v / out_proj (Linear8, 3 each — bias synthesised),
              norm1 (RmsNorm, 1), linear1 (Linear8, 3), linear2 (Linear8, 3),
              norm2 (RmsNorm, 1).

        250. proj_sq_from (Linear8, 3 — bias synthesised).
        253. proj_sq_to (Linear8, 3 — bias synthesised).
        256. promo_bias_proj (Linear8, 3 — bias synthesised). Last.

    Totals: 259 tensors in 104 layers, 69 of them int8 convolutions. Everything else — the
    norms, the biases and the two elo tables — stays fp16, and is 1% of the parameters.

    # The two structural rewrites

    * **The fused `in_proj_weight` is split.** Torch packs q, k and v into one `[768, 256]`
      tensor, in that order (`_in_projection_packed` chunks it three ways). Three separate
      `[256, 256, 1, 1]` kernels come out, each with a synthesised zero bias because
      `omit_qkv_biases=True` and `Builder::conv` always reads one.

    * **`smolgen_shared_weight` is replicated eight times.** Upstream expands the bias
      generator's `[8, 64]` output with `einsum("bhi,oi->bho")` against a `[4096, 64]`
      weight. This runtime has no transpose op, so `nets::maia` expresses that as a
      **grouped 1x1 convolution** with `group = 8` — and a grouped convolution's kernel is
      `[out, in/group, 1, 1]`, which here is `[32768, 64, 1, 1]`: group `g`'s 4096 output
      rows must each hold the same `[4096, 64]` weight. `np.tile` along axis 0 puts them in
      exactly the order group `g` reads.

      It costs +1.84M elements, and at int8 that is +1.8 MB and 30% of the file. It is
      replicated **once, not per block**: the parameter is shared, so all eight blocks pass
      tensor 5 as their `weight_index` and the file holds one copy of the replication.

      The quantisation is done on the `[4096, 64]` original and then tiled, not the other way
      round: the two give identical codes because the replicated rows are identical, but
      quantising 262,144 elements instead of 2,097,152 also makes the fidelity line report the
      tensor the checkpoint actually holds.

    # int8, and why not int4

    Every convolution here is int8, quantised per output channel; the norms, the biases and the
    two elo tables stay fp16. 13.3 MiB to 6.8 MiB, with the worst per-tensor cosine at
    0.999941 against a 0.999 gate.

    `scripts/ml/maia_quant_eval.py` is what justifies that, on move agreement rather than on
    cosine: over 400 positions at each shipping rating the int8 model picks a different move
    0.5% to 1.0% of the time, always where the top two legal moves are within 0.017 — inside
    what fp16 rounding does on its own. The same harness rejects int4 at 87% to 91% agreement
    with 14 to 29 genuine changes of mind, at any group size.

    # What is folded, and what is not

    * The attention query scale is **not** folded into the q kernel. Torch scales the query
      by `head_dim ** -0.5` and `head_dim` is 32, which is the `1 / sqrt(head_dim)`
      `attn_scores` already applies. Folding it would apply it twice.
    * The policy head's `1 / sqrt(head_hid_dim)` is not folded either, for the same reason:
      `head_hid_dim` is 256 and `attn_scores(from, to, 1)` derives `1 / sqrt(256)` itself.
    * `promo_bias_proj`'s `* sqrt(head_hid_dim)` is **not** folded into the kernel. It is
      applied by `post::maia` on the host, where the score it is added to has already been
      divided by the same factor — folding one of the pair and not the other is the easy
      mistake, so neither is folded.
    * The elo interpolation is not folded: the two embeddings are emitted raw and blended
      on the host by `nets::maia::elo_embedding`, because the blend weight is an input.

    Order is the contract, and it is forward order **per tower**, vision first:

        the patch kernel, the class token, the vision positions, `pre_layrnorm`
        each vision layer, then `post_layernorm`, then `visual_projection`
        the token embedding, the text positions
        each text layer, then `final_layer_norm`, then `text_projection`

    The export interleaves the two towers; this does not. See [`ARCHITECTURES`].

    # What is transposed, and what is not

    * A **`MatMul`** weight is `[in, out]` and becomes `[out, in, 1, 1]`, so every projection is
      the `1 x 1` convolution `Builder::conv_int8` already computes.
    * The **`Conv`** patch kernel is `[M, C, kH, kW]` already, which is this runtime's own layout,
      so it is emitted **verbatim**. The `[256, 3, 16, 16]` assertion in [`check_architecture`] is
      what says so; a transpose here would be a plausible-looking embedding.
    * The two **position tables** are `[positions, width]` and the vision one becomes
      `[width, 1, positions]`, because it is added to a sequence the device holds channel-major.
      The text one is **not** transposed: the host reads it, gathers the token rows and adds the
      two in f32, exactly as `nets::small100::embed_positions` does, so it never reaches a shader.

    # What has no bias, and what gets a synthesised one

    The patch embedding and both projections have none — `bias=False` on all three in
    `CLIPModel`. The shaders always add one, so each gets zeros, which is exact and is recorded in
    the digest key so an export that grows a bias is not read as this table.

    Every int8 tensor in this tree goes through here. Nothing reads a pre-quantised export:
    Supertonic's are fp32, and SMaLL-100's only int8 export quantises per tensor, which throws
    away the resolution this recovers - see [`CHECKPOINTS`].

    # Symmetric, with no zero point

    `conv_int8.comp` and `conv_point_int8.comp` compute `scale[o] * sum(int8_w * in)`: there is
    nowhere for a zero point to go, and adding one would cost a second pass over the taps to
    subtract `zp * sum(in)`. So the scale is `absmax / 127` and 0 maps to 0, which is also what
    onnxruntime's dynamic quantiser was measured to emit for SMaLL-100 — every entry of every
    weight zero point in that export is 0.

    127 rather than 128: the range is made symmetric by giving up the one extra negative code, so
    that `-absmax` and `+absmax` both round to a representable value. Using 128 would let a
    weight at exactly `+absmax` quantise to 128, which does not exist in int8.

    # Per output channel, not per tensor

    A row of the kernel is one output channel, and the scale multiplies that row's finished
    accumulator, so a scale per row costs nothing over a scalar — see `Builder::conv_int8`. It
    buys a great deal: a layer whose channels differ in range by 100x loses most of its
    resolution on the quiet ones under a single tensor-wide scale.

    # An all-zero channel

    Its absmax is 0, and `0 / 127` is a scale of 0, which is *correct* — every weight in the row
    is 0, so any scale reproduces it — but it is also a division by zero when computing the
    codes. Those rows are given a scale of 1 instead, which is exact for the same reason and is

    127 codes still resolve a row whose taps vary by an order of magnitude. Four bits have seven
    positive codes. Under one row-wide scale a row containing a single large tap quantises almost
    everything else to zero, so the scale is per block of `block` consecutive taps instead.

    A row is flattened to `in * kh * kw` and cut into blocks of `block`, which is the axis the
    shader's inner loop walks - so a block is contiguous in memory and the shader reads one scale
    per block rather than gathering. The last block of a row is short whenever `taps` is not a
    multiple of `block`, and is scaled on what it actually holds.

#
# The Now Playing models ship as TFLite flatbuffers and there is no ONNX export of them to
# convert through: they were recovered from an APK, and the only route to ONNX would be a
# TFLite -> ONNX converter whose op coverage would have to be trusted for the custom
# `CIRCULAR_BUFFER` and depthwise-with-multiplier layers this graph is mostly made of. Reading
# the flatbuffer here is both shorter and the version whose tensor order can be read off the
# file, which is the only thing the Rust actually depends on.
#
# Two differences from the ONNX path worth knowing:
#
# * A TFLite kernel is `[out, kh, kw, in]` and this runtime wants `[out, in / group, kh, kw]`,
#   so unlike the ONNX path there **is** a transpose here. It is per layer kind, in
#   [`collect_tflite`], and `nets::nnfp`'s `the_layer_table_matches_the_tflite_export` is the
#   assertion on the other side of it.
# * The weights arrive int8 with a scale per tensor and are **dequantised to fp16**, not
#   carried through as [`DTYPE_I8`]. At 172,576 parameters int8 would save nine kilobytes
#   against fp16 - 337 KB versus 346 KB - which does not pay for per-tensor int8 arithmetic
