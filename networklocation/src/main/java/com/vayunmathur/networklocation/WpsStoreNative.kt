/**
 * JNI bridge to the native offline WPSDB reader in the `networklocation` Rust library
 * (see networklocation/src/main/rust/src/wpsdb.rs). It answers exact key → coordinate
 * lookups over a `WPSDB2` store, and serves both offline stores the app ships:
 *   * `wifi-v2.wpsdb`  — 48-bit MAC (BSSID) key → coord + accuracy
 *   * `cells-v2.wpsdb` — 84-bit packed cell key → coord + accuracy
 *
 * A single generic reader handles both because the header carries the key universe width.
 * Keys are 128-bit, passed as a (hi, lo) pair of [Long]s: a MAC leaves `hi` zero, an 84-bit
 * cell key does not. The pair exists because an honest cell key — one that carries the radio
 * type and 5G's full 36-bit NCI — does not fit in 64 bits.
 *
 * The fully-qualified name MUST stay `com.vayunmathur.networklocation.WpsStoreNative` so the
 * JNI symbol mangling (`Java_com_vayunmathur_networklocation_WpsStoreNative_*`) matches.
