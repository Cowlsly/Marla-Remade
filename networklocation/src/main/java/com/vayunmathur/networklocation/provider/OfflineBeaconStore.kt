/**
 * Offline beacon → coordinate resolver over the two WPSDB stores
 * ([OfflineDatabases.WIFI], [OfflineDatabases.CELL]), read by [WpsStoreNative] (native Rust
 * reader) from device-protected storage. They are downloaded rather than bundled, the same as
 * the offline geocoder in `GeocodeService`.
 *
 * Degrades gracefully: if a store has not been downloaded or the native library did not
 * load, the corresponding handle stays 0 and every lookup misses, so no position is reported
 * and a DB-less dev build still works. There is no online fallback. A store that arrives
 * later is picked up on the next lookup ([reopenIfArrived]) rather than at the next process
 * start.
 *
 * Key packing lives in [BeaconKeys] and must stay identical to the builder in
 * `scripts/networklocation/wps_harvest`.
