/**
 * JNI bridge to the native offline geocoder search in the `networklocation` Rust library
 * (see networklocation/src/main/rust/src/geocoder.rs). The database itself is generated
 * offline by `scripts/networklocation/geodb_build` and downloaded to device-protected storage
 * (see [OfflineDatabases]); this object opens it by file descriptor and answers reverse and
 * forward queries entirely in Rust.
 *
 * Results are flat String arrays with [FIELDS_PER_RESULT] entries per result:
 * `[lat, lon, name, house, street, city, state, country, postcode, kind]`, lat/lon to 7 dp.
 *
 * The fully-qualified name MUST stay `com.vayunmathur.networklocation.GeocoderNative` so the
 * JNI symbol mangling (`Java_com_vayunmathur_networklocation_GeocoderNative_*`) matches.
