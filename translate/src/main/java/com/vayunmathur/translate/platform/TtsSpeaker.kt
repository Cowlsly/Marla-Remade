/**
 * Small wrapper over the system default [TextToSpeech] engine that speaks translated
 * text in the *target* language.
 *
 * Two things this has to get right that a bare `engine.language = locale` does not:
 *
 *  - **Locale matching.** [Languages] codes are bare ISO-639-1 ("pt", "zh"), while the
 *    voices an engine actually has installed are usually region-qualified ("pt-BR",
 *    "zh-CN"). Asking for the bare tag can come back unsupported even though the engine
 *    plainly speaks the language, so we search the engine's own voice list for a locale
 *    with the same language and prefer the region the device is in.
 *  - **Failing loudly.** `setLanguage` returns an error code and leaves the *previous*
 *    locale in place when a language isn't installed — engines ship voice data per
 *    language, so anything the user hasn't downloaded lands here. Ignoring that return
 *    value is what made the translation get read aloud in the device language: English
 *    phonetics over Japanese text. We check it and skip the utterance instead, telling
 *    the caller via `onMissingVoice` so it can say so rather than play the wrong thing.
 *
 * Owns the engine lifecycle: create once, [shutdown] when the owner is cleared. A [speak]
 * issued before init completes is queued and replayed, not dropped.
