/**
 * [TranslationEngine] backed by [NllbHandle] - NLLB-200-distilled-600M on `:library:ml`'s
 * Vulkan runtime.
 *
 * The model is loaded lazily from [NllbModel.modelDir] the first time it is needed, and only
 * if the two files have been downloaded; until then [isAvailable] is false and the UI shows
 * a download prompt. Language detection is unnecessary - the UI's source picker names the
 * source - so [detectLanguage] returns null.
 *
 * NLLB needs BOTH the source and the target language: the source token leads the encoder
 * input and the target token forced-BOSes the decoder. A null [from] (the UI's Auto
 * sentinel) falls back to the [AUTO_FALLBACK] source rather than running in the wrong
 * language: native cannot detect, and guessing any other language would mistranslate
 * instead of failing.
 *
 * # The lock is not only for the handle
 *
 * A translation re-records the network once per decoded token, so two concurrent calls
 * would interleave recordings of the same command buffer. The mutex therefore covers the
 * whole of [translate] rather than just the load, and [close] too.
