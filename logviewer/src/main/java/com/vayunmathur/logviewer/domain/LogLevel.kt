/**
 * A logcat severity, and the two textual forms of it the app emits.
 *
 * [label] and [letter] are **wire format, not UI text**: [label] lowercased is the `level:` header
 * line, and [letter] is both the `*:V` argument passed to `logcat` and the ` | E+` suffix in the
 * title. They are deliberately not localised, so a report shared from a French phone reads the same
 * as one shared from an English one. The dialog shows a translated name alongside.
