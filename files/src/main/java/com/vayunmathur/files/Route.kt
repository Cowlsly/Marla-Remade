 * path, because that is what makes Back go up exactly one level and lets the predictive-back
 * preview show the folder the gesture will actually land on. The previous single [Home]/`Browser`
 * pair could not express depth at all, so directory traversal lived in `FilesViewModel.handleBack`
 * and the system gesture had nothing to animate.
