 * giving it a dependency on `:cast:protocol` would hand each of them the wire format, the crypto and
 * the RTP packetiser - which is the entire thing brokering exists to avoid. `:cast` depends on both
 * sides and owns the translation, so the duplication is one file wide and two functions deep, and it
 * buys a public API that cannot leak the protocol.
 *
 * Used in both directions: an app that draws into a `Surface` reports its own player with
 * [CastClient.reportPlaybackState], and an app whose media the TV is *serving* is told about the
 * television's player through [CastClient.onPlaybackState]. Which end owns the truth is whichever end
 * owns the player.
 *
 * A snapshot rather than a delta: absolute in every field, so a lost one repairs itself on the next
 * heartbeat and there is no sequence number to get wrong.
