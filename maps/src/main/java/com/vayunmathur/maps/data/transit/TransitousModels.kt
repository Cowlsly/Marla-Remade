/**
 * Public-transit models for the P10 departure boards (Transitous / MOTIS,
 * open GTFS + GTFS-RT). Two layers of types live here:
 *
 *  - **App models** ([TransitStop], [Departure]) — what the overlay layer, the
 *    ViewModel and the [com.vayunmathur.maps.ui.DeparturesSheet] consume. They
 *    are position/epoch-based and carry no MOTIS wire quirks.
 *  - **Wire DTOs** (the `Motis*` classes) — the subset of the MOTIS v1 REST
 *    responses we actually read. Every field is optional/defaulted and the
 *    [com.vayunmathur.library.network.NetworkClient] JSON is
 *    `ignoreUnknownKeys`, so a MOTIS schema change degrades to nulls rather
 *    than throwing (mirrors the Google-scrape null-safety convention).
 *
 * Only `GET /api/v1/stoptimes` is still called. `/api/v1/map/stops` was replaced
 * by the baked `transit_stops` basemap layer (stops are static data) and
 * `/api/v1/plan` by the on-device RAPTOR planner, so their DTOs are gone.

 * source name the build did not know has none and falls back to its name, so the
 * offline board still opens but no live delays arrive.
