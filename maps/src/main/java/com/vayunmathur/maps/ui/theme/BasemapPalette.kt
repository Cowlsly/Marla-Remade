/**
 * Colours for things drawn on the *tiles* rather than on the app's surfaces.
 *
 * These were hardcoded for a reason, even if an unstated one: `colorScheme.onSurface` is the
 * wrong reference for a road label, because a road label does not sit on a surface — it sits
 * on the basemap, whose colours this file also owns. Deriving them from the wallpaper would
 * let an unlucky accent produce grey-on-grey terrain, and nothing in the scheme expresses
 * "legible against whatever the terrain happens to be".
 *
 * So the basemap gets its own closed palette, contrast-checked against itself. Only the dark
 * palette exists: light mode uses the Protomaps style's own paint verbatim, and the runtime
 * recolour is what dark mode is.
 *
 * Values are `Color`, not hex strings, so they can be contrast-tested. They cross into the
 * style JSON through [toStyleHex] at a single boundary.
