/**
 * Everything the map chrome remembers, and the single place where retain-vs-remember is decided.
 *
 * The rule, applied once here instead of at ten scattered declarations:
 *
 *  * **`retain`** for anything the user *chose* — the travel mode, the category filter, which
 *    sheet is open, whether the camera follows, whether it is north-up. Losing a choice on
 *    rotation reads as the app forgetting what you told it, and all but one of these were
 *    `remember`, so it did.
 *  * **`retain`** also for [postedLimit], which is neither a choice nor cheap: it is re-queried
 *    from the live map on the next GPS fix, so `remember` blanked the speed-limit sign for a
 *    second after every rotation.
 *  * **`remember`** only for the genuinely ephemeral — [lastProgrammaticMoveMs] is a timestamp
 *    used to tell our own camera animation apart from a user pan, and it means nothing once the
 *    composition it was measured in is gone.
 *
 * The properties delegate to the [MutableState] instances handed in, so reads and writes go
 * straight to the retained state; there is no copy to keep in sync.
