/**
 * Map colours that must NOT follow the wallpaper.
 *
 * Everything drawn on the app's own surfaces belongs to `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`. These
 * do not: each one encodes a convention the user already knows from outside the app, and
 * re-hueing it from an arbitrary accent would change what it means. A green traffic jam and
 * a blue speed-limit sign are not restyled UI, they are wrong.
 *
 * They still come in light and dark variants — a fixed hue is not the same as a fixed
 * lightness, and the light-mode values are chosen against a light basemap.
 *
 * Resolve with [mapTokens], passing the map's own dark flag. Plain data rather than a
 * composition local because the map's light/dark state is a setting threaded explicitly (it
 * overrides the system one), and because the route-colour producers that need these are
 * ordinary functions building GeoJSON, not composables.
