/**
 * The overlay layers over the Vulkan basemap that are still plain Compose.
 *
 * The app's own **pins** (saved places, search results, family members, parking) are no longer
 * here: they moved into the renderer as billboarded markers ([com.vayunmathur.library.map.MapMarker],
 * pushed from [MapSurface]), which is what stopped them trailing the basemap on a pan or a tilt.
 * Their taps resolve through the renderer's id buffer
 * ([com.vayunmathur.library.map.Projection.pickMarker]), so the Compose hit-test that rebuilt them
 * is gone too — see [MapSurface].
 *
 * The user puck and the navigation route moved into the renderer earlier, for the same reason (see
 * [com.vayunmathur.library.map.UserPuck] and [com.vayunmathur.library.map.RouteOverlay]).
 *
 * What is still Compose here draws no pins, so none of it lags a pan: satellite imagery, and the
 * roads/safety/transit-stop overlays that remain **no-ops** until the renderer grows a vector
 * source-layer API (reported to lead — symbol-renderer owns that). The basemap draws its own road
 * network and ambient POIs regardless; POI taps arrive as `MapClick.poi`.
 *
 * Traffic is not here: the renderer draws the baked per-component layer, coloured from a table
 * [MapSurface] resolves from the theme and pushes in, gated by the traffic toggle.
