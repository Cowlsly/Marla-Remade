/**
 * The fixed top of the map's bottom sheet, for whatever is selected — the part the
 * sheet's peek height is measured from.
 *
 * Split out of [BottomSheetContent] rather than being its first few rows because
 * `FreeHeightBottomSheetScaffold` takes it as a separate slot and measures it to
 * decide how tall the peek is. Anything drawn here is visible without expanding the
 * sheet; anything [BottomSheetContent] draws is not.
 *
 * Only places have one so far. A selection with no header — a route, an admin label —
 * leaves this empty, which the scaffold reads as "no measurement to work from" and
 * falls back to `MapChromeMetrics.sheetPeekHeight`, exactly as before. [modifier] is
 * applied per branch rather than to a wrapper for the same reason: an empty wrapper
 * still measures its own padding, and here that padding would become the peek height.
