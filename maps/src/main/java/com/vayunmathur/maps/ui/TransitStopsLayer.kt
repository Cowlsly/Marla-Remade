 * toggle wiring all survive the swap untouched.
 *
 * GAP (reported to lead; symbol-renderer owns the renderer API): stops used to render
 * straight from the `transit_stops` source-layer in the overlay PMTiles archive, and
 * library:map has no vector-layer API — so there is nothing to draw them with. The offline
 * `.transit` pack the departure board reads ([OfflineRouter.nearestStop]) answers point
 * queries instead. Mounted only when the Transit layer toggle is on; a tap →
 * the [DeparturesSheet] via [toTransitStop].

 * takes `motis_id`, which is what the realtime board queries; a stop from a feed
 * whose Transitous source name the build did not know has none, and falls back to
