/**
 * Renders the maps basemap onto the Android Auto car [Surface] (P12).
 *
 * `:library:map`'s [SurfaceMapRenderer] draws Vulkan straight into whatever [Surface] it
 * is handed, so the car gets the same renderer, archive and tile cache the phone map uses.
 * Camera, puck and route are pushed in as state and read by the renderer's own
 * Choreographer loop.
 *
 * ## Heading-up, but flat
 *
 * [CameraPosition.bearing] is the compass direction that points up the screen, so passing
 * the course over ground rotates the map to the direction of travel. Tilt is deliberately
 * unsupported by the renderer — a tilt would make the projection perspective and every
 * screen-space measurement downstream assumes it is orthographic — so the car map is
 * heading-up but stays flat, where the pre-Vulkan one was also pitched 45°.
 *
 * ## Threading
 *
 * [SurfaceMapRenderer] is main-thread-only with no lock behind it. [SurfaceCallback] is
 * already dispatched on the main thread; [setCamera], [setPuck] and [setRoute] marshal onto
 * [mainHandler] so callers keep the "safe from any thread" contract this class has always
 * had.
