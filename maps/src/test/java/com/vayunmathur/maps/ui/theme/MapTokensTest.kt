/**
 * [toStyleHex] was written to feed MapLibre, which parses CSS colour syntax, and the trap it
 * closed was that `#aarrggbb` — the form Android's own `Color.parseColor` accepts — is not
 * valid CSS, so an alpha colour serialized the obvious way was silently mis-parsed.
 *
 * That consumer is gone, and the rationale has inverted. The only live caller is now
 * `RouteLayer`, which hands the string to `android.graphics.Color.parseColor` — and that
 * parser accepts `#rrggbb` and `#aarrggbb` but *rejects* `rgba(...)`, which it throws on.
 * So the alpha branch these tests pin now emits the one form its only consumer cannot read.
 *
 * There is no live bug: every route and traffic token is fully opaque (`0xFF…` at
 * `MapTokens.kt:109-112,132-133,145-148,170-171`), so the `#rrggbb` branch is the only one
 * reached. The failure mode if that changes is silent rather than loud —
 * `RouteLayer.kt:66` wraps the parse in `runCatching { … }.getOrDefault(0xFF1710F1)`, so a
 * translucent token would not crash; every affected segment would just quietly draw opaque
 * blue, collapsing the jam/slow/free traffic colouring into one wrong colour.
 *
 * The assertions below are still correct — they pin what [toStyleHex] actually does — so
 * they stay. Giving a route or traffic token an alpha is what needs care, and if the rgba
 * branch ever loses its last justification the function should shed it rather than keep a
 * form nothing can parse.
