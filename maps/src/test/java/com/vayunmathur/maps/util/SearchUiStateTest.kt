/**
 * The false-empty-state bug, encoded as a test.
 *
 * The search page used to decide what to draw from `query.length >= 2 && results.isEmpty()`,
 * which is equally true while a search is running and after one found nothing. So for the whole
 * debounce plus the offline lookup plus the network round-trip it told the user "No results
 * found" about a search that was still going, then replaced it with the results.
 *
 * [SearchUiState.phase] is where that distinction now lives, so this is where it gets defended.
