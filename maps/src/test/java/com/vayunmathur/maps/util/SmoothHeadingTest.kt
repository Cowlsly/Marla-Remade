/**
 * The compass low-pass filter behind the user puck's bearing cone.
 *
 * Pure arithmetic on an angle, so it tests without a sensor. The wrap case is the one that
 * matters: a naive lerp between 359 and 1 takes the 358-degree route and spins the cone
 * all the way round the puck, which is a very visible bug and an easy one to write.
