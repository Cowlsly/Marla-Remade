/**
 * The provider-preference filter behind the user puck's position.
 *
 * GPS and network are registered on the same listener, so before this existed every network fix
 * overwrote the GPS one from a moment earlier and the puck alternated between the road and a few
 * hundred metres off it. The rules are pure arithmetic over a provider flag, an accuracy and a
 * monotonic timestamp, so they test without a device.
 *
 * The cases worth pinning are the two escape hatches, because a GPS-always-wins rule that has no
 * way out strands the puck at the last rooftop the phone saw before walking indoors.
