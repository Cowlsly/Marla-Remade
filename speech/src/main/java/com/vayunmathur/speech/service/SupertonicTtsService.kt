/**
 * System text-to-speech engine backed by offline **Supertonic 3** running on the Vulkan compute
 * runtime in `:library:ml`. Once selected as the device's TTS engine, any app that uses
 * [android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech] — Translate's read-aloud, TalkBack, ebook readers — synthesises
 * fully on-device.
 *
 * # What bundling removed from this service
 *
 * The Piper version of this file asked "is this language installed?" in six of its eleven overrides,
 * because a Piper voice was an 80 MB download that might or might not be on disk. The answer varied
 * per language, per install and over time, so every override had to cope: `onGetVoices` published
 * only extracted voices, `onIsLanguageAvailable` hid the rest, and a legacy English path was
 * threaded through all of them for installs predating the multilingual registry.
 *
 * One bundle in the APK serves all 31 languages, so that question has one answer for the whole
 * install — [SupertonicBundle.isPresent] — and everything downstream of it became unconditional.
 *
 * # Two things a caller will notice
 *
 * * **44,100 Hz, always.** Piper's rate was per-voice, read from each `config.json`; Supertonic's is
 *   fixed by the vocoder. That doubles the PCM byte volume against Piper's 22,050, which is why
 *   [onSynthesizeText] splits every chunk against [SynthesisCallback.maxBufferSize] rather than
 *   trusting one to fit.
 * * **The speech rate is ignored.** See [SupertonicEngine.synthesize] for why.
