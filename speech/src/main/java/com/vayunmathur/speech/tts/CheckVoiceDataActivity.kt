/**
 * Answers the framework's `CHECK_TTS_DATA` probe: the system TTS settings run this before letting
 * the user pick our engine, to learn which voices are installed.
 *
 * The answer must be in the ISO-3 form — `eng-USA`, `deu-DEU` — and it must agree with
 * `SupertonicTtsService.onGetVoices`, which publishes the same pairs. If the two disagree, Settings'
 * Play button silently does nothing, with no error visible anywhere. That is why both sides build
 * the strings from [SupertonicVoices] rather than each spelling them out.
 *
 * # Why this is now a fixed answer
 *
 * With Piper this activity had real work to do: it migrated legacy voice directories, listed which
 * of 42 languages were extracted, and reported the rest as unavailable so Settings could offer them
 * as downloads. All 31 languages ship in the APK now, so either the bundle is there and every
 * language is available, or it is not and none is.
