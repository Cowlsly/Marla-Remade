/**
 * The one Supertonic handle the TTS service speaks through.
 *
 * Replaced `PiperEngine`, which kept an access-ordered LRU of two `PiperSynthesizer`s because a
 * Piper voice *was* a set of networks — changing language meant closing one 80 MB model and
 * opening another. Supertonic has one set of networks for all 31 languages, and a voice is two
 * small style tensors, so there is one handle for the life of the service and switching voices
 * uploads nothing. That is what deleted the cache, the eviction, the per-voice sample rates and
 * the directory resolution along with it.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * [SupertonicSynthesizer] is not thread-safe, so every call here is synchronised on this object.
 * `TextToSpeechService` serialises `onSynthesizeText` itself, but [preload] runs on a background
 * thread from `onCreate` and [close] arrives from `onDestroy`, so the three can overlap.
