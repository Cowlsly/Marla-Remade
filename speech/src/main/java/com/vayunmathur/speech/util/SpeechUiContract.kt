/**
 * The UI contract for the setup screen.
 *
 * The screen takes a state value plus an actions interface rather than reading the device
 * directly, so it can be rendered by a `@Preview` — which is what the store listing images
 * are generated from. It lives in `util` so the dependency runs one way: the UI depends on
 * `util`, never the reverse.
 *
 * There is no ViewModel here. Every field below is a fact about the device (a granted
 * permission, a Settings.Secure entry, a bundled model) that the binder re-reads when
 * the user returns from a settings screen, so the state is assembled at the call site.
 *
 * # What bundling the voices removed
 *
 * This interface had ten members and the state had eight fields, most of them about downloads:
 * per-voice progress, a delete, an installed-codes list, a total byte count. Supertonic ships in
 * the APK, so there is nothing to download, nothing to delete and no progress to poll — the TTS
 * section of the screen went from a list of 42 download rows to a sentence.
