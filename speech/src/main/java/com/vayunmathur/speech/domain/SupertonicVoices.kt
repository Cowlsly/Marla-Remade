/**
 * The languages and voices Supertonic 3 can speak, and the name forms the TTS framework asks for.
 *
 * This replaced a 1,118-line registry. Almost all of that was **delivery**: a mirror URL, a
 * SHA-256, a size estimate and an espeak-ng dictionary name per language, plus the code to
 * download, unzip, migrate and garbage-collect 1,834 MB of voices across 42 archives. One bundle
 * ships in the APK now, so none of it is needed and what is left is identity: given whatever
 * spelling of a language the framework hands us, which language is it.
 *
 * # The 16 languages that went, and the 5 that arrived
 *
 * Supertonic covers 31 languages against Piper's 42, and the difference is deliberate rather than
 * accidental. Gone: Chinese, Hebrew, Thai, Bengali, Telugu, Malayalam, Marathi, Urdu, Serbian,
 * Norwegian, Catalan, Georgian, Kurdish, Luxembourgish, Nepali and Swahili. Arrived: Estonian,
 * Croatian, Lithuanian, Latvian and Slovenian.
 *
 * A language that is not here does not appear in [ALL], so it is never advertised and never shown
 * in the setup screen — a user does not get offered a language and then find it silent.
 *
 * # A voice is not a model
 *
 * Piper's voices were separate networks, one download each. Supertonic's are two small style
 * tensors read against the same four networks, so all ten cost ~250 KB together and switching
 * between them re-uploads nothing. Every language can be spoken by every voice, which is why
 * [VOICES] is a flat list rather than a property of a language.
 *
 * # Why the identity layer is still needed
 *
 * `TextToSpeech` asks for a language in at least four spellings — a BCP-47 tag, an ISO-639-1 code,
 * an ISO-639-2 code with an ISO-3166-3 country, and a voice name that may carry a `-x-` extension —
 * and the `CHECK_TTS_DATA` probe insists on the ISO-3 form specifically. Getting any of them wrong
 * makes the Play button in the system settings silently do nothing, which is a failure mode with no
 * error message anywhere, so all four are kept and [resolve] accepts any of them.
