/**
 * The UI contract between [CalendarViewModel] and the three screens the store listing is
 * shot from (calendar, event detail, settings).
 *
 * Those screens take a state value plus an actions interface rather than the ViewModel
 * itself, so they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — which is what the listing images are
 * generated from. It lives in `util` rather than `ui` so the dependency runs one way:
 * `ui` depends on `util`, and the ViewModel implements these interfaces.
 *
 * The "close" callbacks below are deliberately named per screen. The ViewModel implements
 * every interface here, and two same-named defaults inherited from different interfaces
 * would have to be resolved in the ViewModel itself.
