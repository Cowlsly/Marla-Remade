/**
 * A scheduling-only mirror of upcoming reminders kept in device-protected storage,
 * so alarms can be re-armed at `ACTION_LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED`.
 *
 * The system CalendarProvider is credential-encrypted and simply unreadable before the
 * first unlock after a reboot, so the locked boot pass has no way to discover reminders
 * on its own. It reads this instead. Written by
 * [com.vayunmathur.calendar.util.ReminderScheduler.reconcileAll] while unlocked.
 *
 * PRIVACY - device-protected storage is NOT encrypted with the user's credential, so
 * everything below is readable with the device merely powered on. Event titles are
 * therefore deliberately NOT mirrored; this holds only the numbers needed to compute a
 * trigger time and a PendingIntent request code. A reminder that fires before the first
 * unlock shows the generic "Event reminder" title.
 *
 * Mirroring titles was considered and rejected because it buys almost nothing: the
 * post-unlock reconcile re-schedules the same request codes with FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT,
 * which replaces the intent extras, so every reminder that has not yet fired gets its
 * real title back on unlock for free. Titles would only change what is displayed in the
 * narrow window between a reboot and the first unlock - and would cost leaving every
 * upcoming event title sitting in the clear for as long as the mirror exists.
 *
 * Event ids and start times do still leak here. That is the irreducible minimum: without
 * a time there is no alarm to set, and without an id there is no stable request code.
