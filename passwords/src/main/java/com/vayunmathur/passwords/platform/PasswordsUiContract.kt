/**
 * The UI contract between [PasswordsViewModel] and the screens that the store listing
 * images are rendered from.
 *
 * Those screens take a state value plus an actions interface rather than the ViewModel
 * itself, so a `@Preview` can render them from literal sample data — which matters more
 * here than elsewhere: the real screens only ever show credentials decrypted out of the
 * KDBX vault, and a screenshot generator must never need to open one.
 *
 * It lives in `util` rather than `ui` so the dependency runs one way: `ui` depends on
 * `util`, and the ViewModel implements [PasswordsActions].
