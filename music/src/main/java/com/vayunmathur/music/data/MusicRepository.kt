/**
 * Single source of truth for the music library.
 *
 * Songs, albums and artists come **straight from MediaStore** and live in memory, the way
 * `contacts` reads `ContactsContract`. MediaStore already is the source of truth for them, so
 * mirroring it into a database only bought a cold start with an empty screen: the list could not
 * appear until a worker had finished importing, and after that not until the encrypted database had
 * been opened. Three cursor queries are fast enough to do on every refresh.
 *
 * Room still holds the two things MediaStore cannot give us:
 *  - **playlists** and their song matchings, which are the user's own data. Note that
 *    `MediaStore.Audio.Playlists` is deprecated and deliberately not used.
 *  - a **cache of `duration` and `year`** for files whose MediaStore rows leave them blank.
 *    Recovering those means opening each file with a `MediaMetadataRetriever`, so it is done once,
 *    in the background, and the result is kept. Only those two columns are ever read back; the rest
 *    of the `Music` row is written because the table already has the columns, not because anything
 *    depends on them.
 *
 * This is also the seam for everything else in the app: [com.vayunmathur.music.platform.PlaybackManager],
 * `MusicLibraryTree` (Android Auto) and `CastQueue` subscribe to these flows directly and have no
 * ViewModel, so the in-memory state has to live here rather than in one.
