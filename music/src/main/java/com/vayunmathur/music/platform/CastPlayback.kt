/**
 * Plays this library on a television, by serving it rather than streaming pixels.
 *
 * Casting music was not possible before: the SDK's only session handed back a `Surface` to draw
 * into, and a music player has nothing to draw. A content session has no surface at all - Cast runs
 * an HTTPS proxy, asks this app for a descriptor per track, and the TV decodes the original bytes.
 * So the phone starts no encoder, and the one thing it does encode is Opus, once per file.
 *
 * **The TV is told to play a track before it has finished being encoded, deliberately.** Waiting for
 * the whole transcode first left the television holding an idle control channel for over a minute,
 * and it tore the session down before a note played. Now the resource is offered with an unknown
 * length, `PLAY_MEDIA` goes out at once, and the encoder - which runs several times faster than real
 * time - stays comfortably ahead of the TV's reader.
 *
 * The price is one thing a user can notice: **a track being encoded for the first time cannot be
 * seeked**, because a stream with no known length has nothing to answer a byte range with. It is
 * cached as it goes, so every later play of it is instant and seekable both. [growing] is which
 * resource that currently applies to, and `CastingPlayer` takes the seek commands away while it does.
 *
 * **This object does not decide anything about the queue.** It opens the session, answers for bytes,
 * and carries the television's own playback back through [tv] - `CastQueue` and `CastingPlayer` are
 * what turn that into one player on the phone.
