/**
 * The service Settings binds to, and the whole reason Android's parental controls are reachable
 * on this device.
 *
 * **This exists because a supervision app must exist, not because it does very much.** Android
 * ships the entire feature - the dashboard, the PIN and its recovery, bedtime schedules, app
 * limits, web content and app store filters - in Settings, and enforces policy in
 * `SupervisionService`. What it will not do is show any of it to a device with no supervision app:
 * `SupervisionHelper.hasNecessarySupervisionComponent` resolves `config_systemSupervision` and
 * queries it for [SUPERVISION_BIND_ACTION], and `TopLevelSupervisionPreferenceController` reports
 * `UNSUPPORTED_ON_DEVICE` when nothing answers. On a Pixel the answer comes from a Google
 * component that MAOS does not ship, which is why parental controls looked as though they had
 * been removed from the OS when in fact nothing was there to claim them.
 *
 * **The protocol is reimplemented rather than inherited, and that is a constraint rather than a
 * preference.** The platform side of this contract is `MessengerService` in
 * `frameworks/base/packages/SettingsLib/Ipc`, which a Gradle-built prebuilt cannot link - MAOS
 * apps compile against the public SDK and ship as APKs, so `SettingsLib` is not on the classpath.
 * The wire format is small and fully determined by that class, and is restated in [handle] so the
 * two can be compared when GrapheneOS rebases. **If Settings ever shows empty supervision rows,
 * compare against that file first**: a protocol drift here fails silently, because a malformed
 * reply is indistinguishable from an app with nothing to say.
