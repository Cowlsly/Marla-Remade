 * been the easy mistake. This app holds `SYSTEM_SUPERVISION`, whose permission grant is broad
 * enough that an exported bound service answering everyone would be a way to read how a child's
 * device is supervised from any app on the system.
 *
 * The uid is the only part of an incoming [android.os.Message] that cannot be forged - `arg2`
 * carries a pid the client wrote itself - so the check is uid to package, never the reverse.
