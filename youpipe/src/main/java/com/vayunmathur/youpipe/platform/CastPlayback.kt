/**
 * YouPipe's cast session: where the video goes, and where the audio goes.
 *
 * An object because the two halves live in different places and both have to reach it. The `Surface`
 * is consumed by `VideoPlayer`, which hands it to the `MediaController`; the PCM is produced inside
 * [PlaybackService]'s audio sink, which has no reference to any of the UI. They are in the same process
 * - `PlaybackService` is a `MediaSessionService` in this app - so a singleton is enough and no second
 * IPC hop is needed.
 *
 * **The reason a URL is not handed over instead.** YouPipe's stream URLs are usually synthetic
 * (`sabr://<videoId>?v=<itag>`), resolvable only in-process by `SabrNgDashMediaSource` with a PO token
 * minted through a WebView, and the receiver is deliberately on a LAN with no internet. So what crosses
 * to the TV is pixels and PCM, which is also why ExoPlayer keeps decoding and keeps its transport
 * controls: only the render target changes.
