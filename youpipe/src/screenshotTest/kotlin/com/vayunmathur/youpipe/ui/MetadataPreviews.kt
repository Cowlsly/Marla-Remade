/**
 * Store listing images for `:youpipe`, rendered from Compose previews instead of from an
 * instrumented test on a device. See `common-conventions-preview-metadata`.
 *
 * Things to keep in mind when editing:
 *
 *  - Order comes from the function names. The generated PNG filenames embed them, so
 *    `Preview1Home`/`Preview2Video`/... sort into listing order. Renumber when reordering.
 *  - Everything is a literal, including the "1.2M views | 3 days ago" lines. The app formats
 *    those against the current clock; hard-coding them is what keeps a re-render from
 *    producing a different image tomorrow.
 *  - Thumbnails and avatars are left blank on purpose. Layoutlib has no network, so
 *    [VideoRow] draws its placeholder block instead — which is also what the app shows for
 *    the first few hundred milliseconds of a cold feed.
 *  - The player is a plain black block. Layoutlib cannot render an ExoPlayer surface, so
 *    [VideoDetailScreen] takes it as a slot and these previews stand something in.
 *  - Each preview needs @PreviewTest as well as @Preview, and they must be members of a
 *    class. @Preview alone, or a top-level function, renders in Studio but is not collected
 *    as a screenshot test — which surfaces as "did not discover any tests".
