/**
 * Which stroke parameters take the page->canvas scale, pinned against real Skia output.
 *
 * The ground truth is what `draw.rs::emit_stroke` EMITS, not the wire doc: it multiplies the
 * line width, every dash interval and the dash phase by the CTM scale, leaving all three in the
 * same page space as the point coordinates, and passes `gs.miter_limit` through untouched. The
 * miter limit is a ratio of miter length to line width (PDF 32000-1 8.4.3.5) and is therefore
 * unitless — scaling it would silently change which corners get bevelled as the user zooms.
 *
 * The failure these guard is invisible at 1:1 and only appears under magnification, which is
 * exactly where nobody looks: an unscaled dash interval leaves the period at its page-space
 * pixel count, so a zoomed-in dashed rule reads as a solid one.
 *
 * These need real graphics — the stub android.jar answers every `Paint` getter with a default,
 * so a paint assertion there would pass whatever the code did. The structural save-stack tests
 * live in [DrawSafePageTest].
