 * Compose chrome painted over the WebView rather than the page, and it only works on views
 * attached to a window, while the pool holds detached ones. `getDrawingCache` is deprecated
 * and allocates at full resolution on the main thread.
 *
 * Must run on the main thread — `View.draw` is not thread safe. Draws straight at the target
 * scale so there is no full-size intermediate to resize afterwards.
