 * able to receive a sighting and nothing else, and a bundle with no signing half cannot be used to
 * sign anything in this user's name even by a peer who holds the private side.
 *
 * [kemPrivate] is the **raw ML-KEM private DER**, matching what [PoweredOffKeyStore] stores and
 * what `Pqc.decrypt` expects — deliberately not the composite `[4B kemPrivLen][kemPriv][dsaPriv]`
 * that the word "bundle" means elsewhere in this package. See the [PoweredOffKeyStore] KDoc for

/**
 * Who, besides this device, can decrypt this device's powered-off sightings — and the dedicated
 * keypair that makes answering "somebody" possible without handing out the identity key.
 *
 * ## Why a separate keypair exists at all
 * A powered-off phone cannot decrypt its own sightings; it is off, and by the time it is back on
 * the finding is over. So somebody else has to hold a key. The obvious key is the one the beacon
 * used to use — `ff_pqcKemPriv`, the device's ML-KEM identity private key — and handing that to a
 * family member would let them decrypt **every** live location this user ever publishes, to
 * anyone, forever. That is not a trade worth making for a recovery convenience, so sightings are
 * sealed to a key that can open sightings and nothing else. Compromising it costs the user their
 * powered-off location history; it does not cost them their live location channel.
 *
 * ## What this class will not do
 * The roster starts empty and only ever grows by an explicit [grant]. There is deliberately no
 * "share with everyone I already share location with": the existing roster is a list of people
 * allowed to see where the user is *now*, which is revocable in practice by turning sharing off.
 * A recovery key is not revocable in that sense, so consent for one is not consent for the other.
 *
 * ## Two things rotation cannot undo, which the UI must say out loud
 *  - A grantee also needs the beacon secret, because [PoweredOffProtocol.recentHandles] is what
 *    tells them which handles to fetch. Holding it lets them derive this device's EIDs and track
 *    the powered-off phone themselves for as long as the keypair lives. For a person the user
 *    picked by name that is inside the trust model, but it is a real capability and not a
 *    side effect worth hiding in a comment.
 *  - [revoke] rotates, which stops the revoked peer opening anything sealed **after** it. It
 *    cannot claw back ciphertexts they already fetched, and it cannot stop them having written
 *    the old key down. Revocation is forward-only. Saying otherwise in the UI would be a lie.
 *
 * Rotation also retires the previous private key outright, so sightings still sitting on the relay
 * sealed to the old public half become unreadable to the owner too. That is the honest cost of
 * revoking mid-window and is preferred to keeping a retired key alive to satisfy it.
