/**
 * Scans for powered-off beacons ([PoweredOffBle]) and emits a [PoweredOffSighting] for each.
 *
 * This is the half of powered-off finding that needs **no privileged permission and no custom
 * OS**. Arming a beacon requires `BLUETOOTH_PRIVILEGED`, which is `signature|privileged`, so only
 * a preinstalled build can do it — but hearing one is ordinary `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`, so any phone
 * with findfamily on it can contribute sightings. Keep it that way: nothing in this file, or
 * anything it calls, may come to depend on a privileged API.
 *
 * ## Battery
 * A finder is doing a favour for a stranger, so this has to cost close to nothing or nobody will
 * leave it on and the network is worthless. Three things do the work:
 *  - **Hardware offload filtering.** [PoweredOffBle.scanFilter] matches on the service-data
 *    prefix, so the controller discards non-FMDN advertisements without waking the application
 *    processor. On a busy street that is essentially all of them.
 *  - **First-match callbacks.** With offloaded filtering the controller reports each matching
 *    device *once* rather than every 2 seconds forever. A beacon's EID only rotates every
 *    [PoweredOffProtocol.SLOT_SECONDS], so per-advertisement callbacks would be ~500 wakeups per
 *    beacon per useful report. Where the controller can't do it we fall back to
 *    `CALLBACK_TYPE_ALL_MATCHES` and [PoweredOffReporting] dedupes in software instead —
 *    correct either way, just less efficient.
 *  - **Low-power duty cycle**, the longest window/interval the framework offers.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no wakelock**. This runs inside the existing location foreground
 * service; if that service is not running we simply are not a finder for a while, which is the
 * right trade for someone else's benefit.
