/**
 * Owner-only persistence for bound trackers. Holds, per tracker userid, the two
 * secrets that never leave the owner's device:
 *  - the beacon master secret (used to recompute rotating epoch-ids), and
 *  - the tracker's ML-KEM **private** bundle (used to decrypt crowd reports).
 *
 * The tracker's **public** bundle is stored on the `User` row itself
 * (`User.pqcEncryptionKey`), reusing the existing key-directory plumbing. The set
 * of owned trackers is simply the `User` rows with `kind == UserKind.TRACKER`, so
 * no separate index is kept here.
 *
 * The tracker's BLE address is kept here too. It isn't secret, but the owner needs it
 * to re-open GATT for a UWB find ([TrackerUwbGatt.startRanging]) — the crowd-finding
 * path only ever scans by service UUID, so nothing else would retain it.
