/**
 * The on-air shape of a powered-off beacon, and the one part of this feature that is **assumed
 * rather than verified**. Read this before trusting the scanner.
 *
 * ## Why it cannot be read out of the source
 * Powered-off beacons are emitted after Android is gone, by the Bluetooth controller itself. All
 * the HAL does is hand the controller a list of 20-byte keys and some advertising parameters
 * over vendor HCI opcode `0xfd62`
 * (`hardware/interfaces/bluetooth/bluetooth_hal/extensions/finder/bluetooth_finder_handler.cc`).
 * It sets the advertising interval (2000ms), the TX power (0x0A), the key rotation period
 * (1024s) and a 20s start delay — and nothing else. Closed controller firmware composes the
 * actual advertisement. There is no service UUID, no frame type and no payload assembly anywhere
 * in the platform tree, so the byte layout below is **not confirmed by anything we can read**.
 * Confirming it needs an on-air capture from a powered-off device.
 *
 * ## What is assumed
 * Service data under one of [CANDIDATE_SERVICE_UUIDS], laid out as:
 * ```
 * [0]      frame type 0x40
 * [1..21]  20-byte EID
 * [21]     hashed flags (optional, ignored)
 * ```
 * Two service UUIDs are matched because the evidence points at one and does not rule out the
 * other, and guessing wrong costs everything: the symptom of a wrong UUID is a scanner that
 * matches nothing, silently, forever. [FAST_PAIR_UUID] (0xFE2C) is the stronger candidate —
 * Find My Device Network is built on top of Google Fast Pair, and 0xFE2C is the only relevant
 * service constant anywhere in the tree
 * (`packages/modules/Bluetooth/.../le_scan/MsftAdvMonitorTest.kt`, credit to the lead for
 * finding it). [EDDYSTONE_UUID] (0xFEAA) is kept as a second filter because Eddystone-EID is the
 * other published 20-byte EID format. Both filters are evaluated in controller hardware, so
 * carrying the second one costs no battery.
 *
 * If a capture ever settles it, delete the loser and nothing else changes: [FRAME_TYPE] and
 * [EID_OFFSET] are the only other guesses, and nothing downstream of [PoweredOffScanner] depends
 * on any of them. The derivation, the sealing, the upload and the retrieval are all unaffected.
