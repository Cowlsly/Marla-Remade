/**
 * Shared contract for powered-off finding. **Both halves of the feature derive from this
 * object** — the beacon half arms the Bluetooth controller with [eids] before shutdown, the
 * finder half matches what it hears and the owner half looks reports up by [handleOf]. If the
 * two halves ever disagree the feature fails completely silently: no error, no log, just zero
 * sightings forever. Change nothing here without changing both sides.
 *
 * ## Why this is separate from [TrackerProtocol]
 * Powered-off beacons are emitted by the Bluetooth *controller* after Android is gone, so the
 * shape is dictated by the vendor HCI interface rather than by us
 * (`hardware/interfaces/bluetooth/bluetooth_hal/extensions/finder/`). Two constants there are
 * not negotiable and neither matches the UWB tracker network:
 *  - `Eid.aidl` is literally `byte[20] bytes` and the vendor command copies exactly 20 bytes
 *    per key, so [EID_LEN] is 20, not [TrackerProtocol.EPOCH_ID_LEN].
 *  - the HAL hardcodes `kPrecomputedKeyRotatedInterval = 0x400`, so [SLOT_SECONDS] is 1024, not
 *    [TrackerProtocol.EPOCH_SECONDS]. Deriving on the tracker's 900s period would drift 124s per
 *    slot against the controller's own timer and desynchronise within a couple of hours.
 * A distinct [EID_DOMAIN] keeps the two id spaces from ever colliding.
 *
 * ## Slot anchoring — the subtle part
 * The controller starts key index 0 shortly after shutdown and advances every [SLOT_SECONDS] on
 * its own timer, so its schedule is anchored to *shutdown time*, not to the wall clock. The
 * beacon half still derives on wall-clock slots and arms key 0 = the slot containing the
 * shutdown instant. The consequence is that a key is emitted slightly *later* than the slot it
 * was derived for, by an amount strictly less than one slot that does not accumulate. That
 * bounded lag is the whole reason the owner queries [recentHandles] backwards in time rather
 * than for a single slot. A shutdown-anchored counter would not be derivable by anyone who does
 * not already know the shutdown timestamp, which is why we do not use one.
 *
 * ## The EID is not a public key
 * The AOSP javadoc describes Find My Device network EIDs as "the public part of asymmetric key
 * pairs" that finders encrypt to directly. That is not implementable here: 20 bytes cannot hold
 * an X25519 or ML-KEM-768 public key, and Google only manages it by using secp160r1, which
 * Conscrypt does not support. So an EID here is an opaque rotating *handle*; the actual
 * encryption target is the device's ML-KEM-768 public bundle, which the finder fetches by
 * handle. See [PoweredOffReporting] for what that costs in privacy terms.

     * a single byte on the wire (`command[5]` and `command[10]` in
     * `bluetooth_finder_handler.cc`), so 0..255 is everything it can address. At
     * [SLOT_SECONDS] each that is 72.8 hours — a little over three days of powered-off
     * advertising, which is the real limit on how long a switched-off phone stays findable.
     *
     * What the controller does when the list runs out is **not specified anywhere we can read**.
     * The likeliest behaviour by a distance is that it stops advertising, since a beacon that
     * degenerated into a static identifier after three days would trip the unwanted-tracking
     * standard Google co-authored. That is inference from the fact that Google ships this same
     * HAL on retail hardware, not something confirmed from source, and it should keep being
     * described that way.
