/**
 * Ties powered-off sightings to the relay, for both roles.
 *
 * ## The privacy property, stated exactly
 * A finder sees an opaque rotating [PoweredOffProtocol.eid], asks the relay for the ML-KEM-768
 * *public* bundle it belongs to, seals **its own** GPS position to that bundle, and uploads the
 * ciphertext. So:
 *  - the **finder** learns a random-looking 20 bytes and a public key. Not an identity, not a
 *    name, not where the beaconing device is, not even that it is a phone. Its own userid is
 *    stripped from the sealed payload, so the owner cannot tell who found their device either.
 *  - the **relay** stores bytes it has no key for.
 *  - only the **owner**, or a peer they deliberately shared with, can open it.
 *
 * What is *not* true, and should not be claimed: the relay does learn "handle X was sighted",
 * and since it holds the registration it can tie that to a device. It does not learn where — the
 * position is inside the ciphertext. That linkability is inherent to the existing crowd design
 * rather than something added here, but it is real.

     * The sealing side needs no equivalent care: finders seal with `Pqc.encryptTo`, which takes a
     * *public* bundle, and the relay hands back this user's ordinary public bundle, which is
     * already in that shape.
