/**
 * The keys needed to read a device's powered-off sightings, held per device userid.
 *
 * ## Who holds what, and why it matters
 * A powered-off phone cannot decrypt anything — it is off, and by the time it is back on you
 * have already found it. So keeping the private key only on the device that beacons would make
 * the whole feature useless. The AOSP javadoc anticipates this: reports are readable by "the
 * device owner **or someone that the device owner shared the key with**".
 *
 * So there are two cases, and this store handles both identically:
 *  - **your own device**, whose keys you keep so you can look up its sightings from your tablet
 *    or after it comes back;
 *  - **a family member's device**, whose keys they sent you over the existing end-to-end
 *    encrypted peer channel when they armed it, so you can go and look for their lost phone.
 *
 * Handing someone your powered-off private key lets them locate that device for as long as the
 * key lives, so the beacon half must only ever distribute it to peers the user has explicitly
 * chosen — it is not something to sync to everyone by default.
 *
 * The secret is the same per-device value the rest of the crowd network uses; it is here rather
 * than in [TrackerStore] because [TrackerStore] is keyed on tracker `User` rows and these are
 * ordinary people.
 * ## What is stored, and why the name matters
 * The key half is the device's **raw ML-KEM private DER** for its dedicated *recovery* keypair —
 * never `ff_pqcKemPriv`, the identity key the beacon half used to file here. That key decrypts
 * every live location the user publishes to anyone, and this store exists to be handed to other
 * people, so the two must not meet. See [PoweredOffRecovery].
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT the composite `[4B kemPrivLen][kemPriv][dsaPriv]` that the word "bundle"
 * means everywhere else in this package. A tracker's identity is minted on its behalf and is
 * composite; a powered-off phone's recovery key is a bare ML-KEM private key. These accessors are
 * named [kemPrivateKey] rather than `privateBundle` because calling it a bundle already caused one
 * silent bug: the value was fed to [TrackerProtocol.kemPrivFromPrivateBundle], which read the
 * DER's leading SEQUENCE header as a length field and failed every decrypt. Both shapes are
 * `ByteArray`, so nothing but the name stops the next caller repeating it. Decrypt this with
 * `Pqc.decrypt` directly.
 *
 * The set of owned trackers is simply the `User` rows with `kind == UserKind.TRACKER`, so
 * no separate index is kept here.
