/**
 * The UI contract between [FindFamilyViewModel] and the bottom-sheet screens on the map
 * page.
 *
 * The sheets take a state value plus an actions interface rather than the ViewModel itself,
 * so they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — which is what the store listing images are
 * generated from. That matters more here than elsewhere: the map underneath the sheet is a
 * tile renderer that Layoutlib cannot draw, so the sheets are the only part of the main
 * screen a preview can show.
 *
 * This lives in `util` rather than `ui` so the dependency runs one way: `ui` depends on
 * `util`, and the ViewModel implements these interfaces.
