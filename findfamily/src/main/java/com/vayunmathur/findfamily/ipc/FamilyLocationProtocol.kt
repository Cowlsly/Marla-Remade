/**
 * Wire contract for the cross-app live family-location channel exposed by
 * [FamilyLocationService].
 *
 * A Messenger-based protocol is used (rather than AIDL) so the whole contract is
 * plain Kotlin with no generated stubs or shared module: the maps app declares a
 * byte-for-byte copy of these constants and talks to the service over the same
 * action + message codes + Bundle keys. The service is guarded by the existing
 * signature permission [PERMISSION] (both MA apps share the signing key), so only
 * co-signed callers can bind.
