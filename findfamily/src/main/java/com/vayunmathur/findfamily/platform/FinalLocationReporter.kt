/**
 * Publishes one last position when the device is about to stop reporting — on shutdown or
 * reboot, and when the battery crosses the system's low threshold.
 *
 * This is the cheap answer to "where did I lose it": a phone that is switched off or flat is
 * indistinguishable from one out of coverage, and the last live heartbeat can be half an hour
 * old. A parting report collapses that to the moment the device actually went away.
 *
 * Three things this deliberately does *not* do:
 *
 * - **It does not wait for a fresh fix.** The shutdown window is a couple of seconds, and a GPS
 *   lock takes tens. Whatever the tracking service last held is what gets sent, however stale.
 * - **It does not claim that position is current.** The fix's own measurement time goes out as
 *   [LocationValue.timestamp] and the moment of the shutdown as [LocationValue.reportedAt], so a
 *   receiver can say "last seen twenty minutes before it switched off" rather than dropping a pin
 *   where the phone demonstrably is not.
 * - **It does not reconnect, look up keys, or touch the database.** Every one of those can block
 *   for seconds. It publishes to peers whose keys are already cached, over a socket that is
 *   already open, or it publishes nothing and says so in the log.
 *
 * Registration has to happen at runtime, from the running tracking service. Both halves of that
 * were checked against the platform source in this tree:
 *
 * - `ShutdownThread.java:548` adds `FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY` to the shutdown broadcast, and
 *   `Intent.ACTION_SHUTDOWN`'s own javadoc says it has only gone to `registerReceiver` callers
 *   since P. A manifest entry would never fire.
 * - `frameworks/base/data/etc/framework-sysconfig.xml` is the `allow-implicit-broadcast`
 *   exemption list, and its 23 entries are all telephony, SMS, media and package actions.
 *   `ACTION_BATTERY_LOW` is not among them, so it is caught by the API-26 background limits.
 *   Same conclusion, different mechanism.
 *
 * `ACTION_REBOOT` is in the filter as belt and braces. A reboot on this platform goes through
 * ShutdownThread and arrives as `ACTION_SHUTDOWN`; nothing in `services/core` broadcasts
 * `ACTION_REBOOT`, though Watchdog is built around receiving it, so it is not impossible.
 *
 * The corollary of runtime registration is that this only works while the tracking service is
 * alive — if the user has tracking switched off, there is nothing to report from.
