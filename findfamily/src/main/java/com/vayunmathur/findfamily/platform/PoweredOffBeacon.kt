/**
 * Powered-off finding, beacon half: hands the Bluetooth controller a batch of rotating ephemeral
 * identifiers just before the device powers down, so a family member walking past can still
 * sight it.
 *
 * Off unless the user has explicitly turned it on. See [isEnabled].
 *
 * The scheme itself lives in [PoweredOffProtocol] and is deliberately **not** restated here — the
 * finder half derives from the same object, and two copies of a derivation that must agree
 * byte-for-byte is exactly how this feature fails silently. This class only decides *when* to
 * arm, *what* to persist, and *what* to tell the user.
 *
 * ## What the platform does with the list
 *
 * `NearbyManager.setPoweredOffFindingEphemeralIds` copies it into the Bluetooth controller's own
 * memory over vendor HCI `0xfd62`. Once the AP is down the controller — not Android — advertises
 * it: ~20 s delay, then index 0, advancing one index every 1024 s at a 2 s advertising interval.
 *
 * The consequences are all in [PoweredOffProtocol]: 256 keys maximum because the key index is one
 * byte on the wire, so 3.03 days of coverage per shutdown, and unspecified behaviour when the
 * list runs out. That last one is the reason for [ARM_CONTROLLER] below.

     *
     * Everything else in this class runs regardless: EIDs are derived, registered with the relay
     * and persisted, and the user-facing switch works. This gates only the final
     * `setPoweredOffFindingMode(ENABLED)` — the step that makes a switched-off phone transmit.
     *
     * It is dev-only on purpose, and the reason is not caution for its own sake. What the
     * controller does when it walks past the last key is not defined in the AIDL, the HAL, or any
     * test we can read; the walk happens in closed Broadcom firmware. If it stops, the feature
     * quietly expires after three days. If it wraps, the phone replays the same 256 identifiers
     * on a loop until the battery dies, and an observer who sees one twice knows it is the same
     * device — a fixed trackable identifier emitted by a phone the user believes is off. We
     * cannot test which, cannot fix it if it is the bad one (the SoC is down; nothing can refill
     * the buffer), and the app's threat model includes the people best placed to notice.
     *
     * The team's position is that stopping is far more likely, because Google ships this same
     * controller on retail Pixels and a static identifier would trip the unwanted-tracking
     * standard they co-authored. That is inference, not proof, and it is not enough to ship a
     * transmitter on. Flip this to unconditional when someone documents the firmware behaviour.

     * as a length field and every decrypt fails into a log line. It has already happened once.

     * public bundle, and the relay already holds this user's public bundle in that shape.
     *
     * NOT DONE, and the feature is much weaker without it: sharing these keys with a chosen family
     * member. A powered-off phone cannot decrypt its own sightings, so today this only helps a
     * user who has a second device of their own signed in. `PoweredOffKeyStore` is already keyed
     * by userid to hold a peer's keys; the distribution path over the e2ee peer channel, and the
     * UI to choose who gets them, are not written. Handing someone this key lets them locate the
     * device for as long as it lives, so it must never be synced to the whole roster by default.
