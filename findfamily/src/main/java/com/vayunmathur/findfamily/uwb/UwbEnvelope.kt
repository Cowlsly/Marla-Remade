 *    and so decides *what to ask the relay for*. It is also, unavoidably, the ability to derive
 *    this device's EIDs and recognise it in the wild.
 *  - [recoveryPrivB64] is the raw ML-KEM private DER that opens the sightings. Deliberately the
 *    dedicated recovery key and never `ff_pqcKemPriv`, which would hand over every live location
 *    this user publishes rather than only their powered-off sightings.
 *
 * [epoch] exists because delivery is asynchronous and rotation is not: a redistribution triggered
 * by a revoke can overtake an older grant still in the queue, and a peer that stored the older
 * one last would sit there polling with a dead key. Recipients keep the highest epoch they have
 * seen and drop anything below it.
 *
 * [sigB64] authenticates the sender, which the channel itself does not — see
 * [com.vayunmathur.findfamily.tracker.poweredOffGrantSigningBytes] for why an unsigned grant
 * would let one connected peer put forged locations on the map under another's name.
