/**
 * A link id is the server-side *recipient id* — it is what `/api/location/publish` addresses
 * and what the `findfamily.cc/view/<id>` URL resolves to — and it shares that namespace with
 * [com.vayunmathur.findfamily.data.User] ids, which are random 64-bit values.
 *
 * So it must be globally unique, not a per-device row number: with Room's `autoGenerate` every
 * device's first link was id 1, so every first `/view/1` URL pointed at the same server queue
 * and every device published its encrypted location into it.
 *
 * Positive-only, matching the userid generation in `Networking.init` — the server stores these
 * as ULong and a negative value round-trips inconsistently.
