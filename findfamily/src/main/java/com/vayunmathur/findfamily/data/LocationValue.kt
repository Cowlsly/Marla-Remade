/**
 * Why a fix was published, so a receiver can tell a live report from a device's parting shot.
 *
 * Stored by Room as the enum name and carried on the wire as that same string. A value this
 * build does not recognise decodes to [UNKNOWN] rather than throwing or being guessed at — see
 * [LocationValueCompatible].
 *
 * ## Adding a value here is a wire-compatibility decision. Read this first.
 *
 * A peer older than your new value will **drop** fixes carrying it (see [UNKNOWN]). That is only
 * safe because every value below except [LIVE] is *supplementary*: a device still emits [LIVE]
 * for its ordinary heartbeat, so an older peer that discards the rest still tracks the person
 * normally and merely misses the extra context.
 *
 * **Do not add a value that becomes a device's primary or only report stream.** If you do, that
 * person does not appear stale on older peers — they vanish outright, with no pin and no error,
 * and the user cannot tell "they stopped sharing" from "my build is too old to understand them".
 * In a family-location app that silence is its own safety failure.
 *
 * If you genuinely need a new primary stream, change the receiving policy first: ship a build
 * that downgrades rather than drops, wait for it to reach the fleet, and only then start
 * emitting. The drop cannot be the thing you rely on.

    /**
     * A source string this build has never heard of, from a peer newer than it. Never published —
     * decode-only.
     *
     * This exists because the categories are not interchangeable. [NETWORK_SIGHTING] is the
     * proof: its coordinate is *someone else's* position, so a build that guessed "probably
     * [LIVE]" would render a stranger's location as a precise, current fix of the person being
     * looked for, and send whoever is searching to the wrong place. That is the worst direction
     * for this app to be wrong in, and there is no way to know in advance which future category
     * carries the same trap.
     *
     * So an unrecognised source is treated as unusable rather than assumed benign, and inbound
     * fixes carrying it are dropped (see `LocationTrackingService.processIncomingLocations`).
     * That is safe only while new categories stay supplementary to [LIVE] — see the note on the
     * enum itself before adding one. Note this is distinct from a peer that omits the field
     * entirely: those predate the field, only ever sent live reports, and correctly decode
     * to [LIVE].
