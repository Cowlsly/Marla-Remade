/**
 * Pure-JVM tests for how a received payload's `source` and `reportedAt` are decoded.
 *
 * These exist because the decode rules are safety-relevant rather than merely correct, and
 * because the original version of this logic shipped a bug that no compiler or lint check
 * could have caught: unrecognised sources fell back to [LocationSource.LIVE], which would have
 * drawn a [LocationSource.NETWORK_SIGHTING]'s coordinate — someone *else's* position — as a
 * precise current fix of the person being looked for.
 *
 * The two directions are deliberately asymmetric and both are pinned here, because collapsing
 * them back into one rule is the obvious "simplification" that would reintroduce the bug.
