 * Store listing images for `:notes`. See `common-conventions-preview-metadata`.
 *
 * Each preview needs @PreviewTest as well as @Preview: @Preview alone renders in Studio but
 * is not collected as a screenshot test. Previews must also be class members, not top-level
 * functions. Order comes from the function names (Preview1…, Preview2…).
 *
 * Everything here is a literal — no ViewModel, no database, no device — which is also what
 * makes the images reproducible from a clean checkout. Block ids are spelled out for the
 * same reason: the default is a random UUID, which would change the `key()` identity (and
 * so the render) on every run.
