/**
 * A pragmatic FSRS weight optimizer. Given a deck's [ReviewLog] history grouped and
 * ordered per card, it runs **coordinate descent** to minimise the binary log-loss
 * between the model's predicted recall and the observed pass/fail, over a bounded
 * subset of the 19 FSRS weights, seeded from [Scheduler.DEFAULT_W].
 *
 * This is intentionally *not* a bit-exact reimplementation of Anki's optimizer — it
 * is a lightweight, dependency-free, unit-testable estimate. Pure Kotlin.
