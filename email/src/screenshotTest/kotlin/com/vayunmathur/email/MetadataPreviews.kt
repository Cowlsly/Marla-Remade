/**
 * Store listing images for `:email`, rendered from Compose previews instead of from an
 * instrumented test on a device.
 *
 * `./gradlew :email:metadata` renders these and copies the PNGs into
 * `metadata_data/photos/email/`, where `release.sh` picks them up.
 *
 * Two things to keep in mind when editing:
 *
 *  - Order matters, and it comes from the function names. The generated PNG filenames
 *    embed the function name, so `Preview1Inbox`/`Preview2Conversation`/... sort into
 *    listing order no matter how the plugin formats the rest of the filename. Renumber the
 *    functions if you reorder the listing.
 *  - Everything must be a literal. These render with no ViewModel, no database and no mail
 *    server, so the messages below are the whole input — which is also what keeps the
 *    output reproducible from a clean checkout, and is why no real account is involved.
 *  - Each preview needs @PreviewTest as well as @Preview. @Preview alone renders in
 *    Studio but is not collected as a screenshot test, and the build fails with the
 *    unhelpful "did not discover any tests".
 *  - The previews must be members of a class, not top-level functions. Android Studio
 *    renders top-level previews happily, but the screenshot engine discovers previews as
 *    JUnit tests and needs a real class to attach them to — top-level functions land in a
 *    synthetic `…Kt` facade and are silently skipped.
