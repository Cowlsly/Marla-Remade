/**
 * When a medication should be taken, and therefore when to remind.
 *
 * Deliberately smaller than an RFC-5545 recurrence rule. The clock app's model — one time and a
 * weekday mask — cannot say "twice a day" or "every other week", and calendar's `RRule` covers
 * BYSETPOS, BYYEARDAY and BYWEEKNO that no medication regimen needs and is in any case private to
 * that app. Between [times], [interval] and [daysOfWeek] this covers the realistic space:
 *
 *  - every other week, Mon and Thu, 08:00 and 20:00 → Weekly, 2, {Mon,Thu}, [08:00, 20:00]
 *  - every 3 days at 09:00                          → Daily, 3, [09:00]
 *  - twice daily                                    → Daily, 1, [08:00, 20:00]
 *
 * At most one per medication, and deleting the medication deletes it.
