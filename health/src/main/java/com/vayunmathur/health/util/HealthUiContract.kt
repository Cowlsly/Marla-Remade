/**
 * The UI contract between [HealthViewModel] plus the back stack and the handful of screens
 * the store listing is captured from.
 *
 * Those screens take a state value and an actions interface rather than the ViewModel, so
 * they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — see `src/screenshotTest`, which is where the
 * listing images come from. Health Connect, Room and the bundled food database do not exist
 * there, which is exactly what makes the images reproducible from a clean checkout.
 *
 * Only Today, Nutrition and the metric detail screen are split this way. Every other screen
 * still takes the ViewModel directly; splitting the whole app would be a large change for
 * no benefit.
 *
 * It lives in `util` rather than `ui` so the dependency runs one way: `ui` depends on
 * `util`, never the reverse.
