/**
 * The UI contract between [MeasureViewModel] and the pages in `ui.pages`.
 *
 * Pages take a state value plus an actions interface rather than the ViewModel itself, so
 * they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — which is what the store listing images are
 * generated from (see `src/screenshotTest`). It lives beside the ViewModel rather than in
 * `ui.pages` so the dependency runs one way: `ui.pages` depends on `ui`, and the ViewModel
 * implements these interfaces.
 *
 * Every actions method has a no-op default body, so [CompassActions.Noop] and friends are
 * the whole implementation a preview needs.
