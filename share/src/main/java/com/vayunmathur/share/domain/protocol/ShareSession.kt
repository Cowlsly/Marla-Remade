 * Thin lifecycle wrapper around the native session handle. Dispatch on
 * [state] in your UI (Handshaking → AwaitingAccept → Transferring → Completed/Failed).
 *
 * [isInitiator] must reflect which side opened the TCP socket: `true` for the dialler,
 * `false` for the acceptor. Only the initiator sends `CONNECTION_REQUEST`, and only the
 * initiator is the UKEY2 client, so getting this wrong deadlocks the handshake.
 *
 * [localEndpointInfo] and [localEndpointId] must be the ones this device advertises: the
 * peer matches `CONNECTION_REQUEST` against what it discovered, and drops the connection
 * when either is missing or malformed.
 *
 * Usage (one instance per TCP connection / peer):
 * ```
 * val session = ShareSession(localName = "My Phone", isInitiator = true)
 * try {
 *     // after TCP connect, pump bytes:
 *     session.feedInbound(socket.read())
 *     session.drainOutbound()?.let { socket.write(it) }
 *     when (session.state) {
 *         AwaitingAccept -> showIncoming(session.pendingFiles)
 *         // on user tap:
 *         // session.accept(true, destDir); session.openFile(...); ...
 *         else -> {}

 * } finally { session.destroy() }
