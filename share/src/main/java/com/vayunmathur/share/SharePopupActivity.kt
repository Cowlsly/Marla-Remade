/**
 * The system share sheet's target: a half-height bottom sheet over whatever app shared the files.
 *
 * Opening the whole app for a share is a detour — the files are already chosen, so the only thing
 * left is picking a device, and that is all this shows. The window is transparent
 * (`Theme.SharePopup`) so the Compose sheet's own scrim is the only thing drawn over the app below.
 *
 * Nothing here stops the scan: [ShareViewModel.connectToDevice] stops it when a device is chosen
 * (the radios are needed for the transfer) and `onCleared` stops it when this activity goes away.
