/**
 * Runtime permissions for the Share module (mirrors AndroidManifest.xml).
 *
 * Deliberately short. `:share` asks for nothing it can avoid:
 *  - **no storage or media permissions** — files to send are picked with `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`
 *    and saved with `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`, each of which grants access to exactly the URI the
 *    user chose; received files live in app-private storage and leave through a `FileProvider`.
 *  - **no location** — `minSdk` is 31, so `neverForLocation` on `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` covers scanning
 *    outright; the pre-Android-12 classic-scan fallback that needed `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
 *    cannot be reached.
 *  - **no `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`** — the peer's name comes from its advertisement, never from
 *    `BluetoothDevice.getName()`.
 *
 * `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is not optional for receiving: notifications *are* the receive UI, so
 * [com.vayunmathur.share.platform.receive.ShareReceiveTileService] refuses to turn receiving on
 * without it.
