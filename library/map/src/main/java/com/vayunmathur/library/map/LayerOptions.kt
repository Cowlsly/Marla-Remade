/**
 * Which optional map layers to draw. Both are off by default.
 *
 * Every `.mamaps` archive already carries POI and transit data — the tiler has emitted both
 * for some time — but nothing drew either, so every archive paid storage, bandwidth and
 * decode cost for bytes that were discarded. Turning them on is opt-in rather than opt-out
 * because most consumers (findfamily, photos, weather, taxi, fooddelivery) show a map as a
 * backdrop for their own pins, and neither layer helps that: POI icons compete with the pin,
 * and rail lines are noise outside a transit app. `maps` opts into transit, driven by its
 * own layers toggle.
 *
 * # What turning one on costs
 *
 * Unlike the light/dark switch, this is not free. Both layers are gated at **tessellation**
 * time precisely so that leaving them off costs nothing — with [poi] off no label is shaped
 * and no collision candidate is built for any resident tile. The price is that flipping
 * either one invalidates the meshes already on the GPU, so the renderer re-tessellates the
 * resident tiles from the archive it already holds. No tile is refetched and none is
 * evicted; the existing meshes keep drawing until their replacements land, so the map does
 * not blank. Expect a brief burst of worker activity, not a reload.
 *
 * Setting the same values again is a no-op, so it is safe to pass a freshly-constructed
 * instance on every recomposition.

     * `poi-*` layers hold forty kinds between them and a chip selects a handful — so it
     * cannot be expressed by turning layers off. Basemap layers are never narrowed by it:
     * selecting "Coffee" hides other POIs, not the roads.
     *
     * A name the archive schema does not know is ignored rather than treated as an error.

     * re-tessellates the resident set. Order does not matter and duplicates are fine —
     * equality is by content, so a freshly-built set each recomposition is a no-op.
