//! Turns MVT polygon geometry into fill triangles.
//!
//! The bridge between `tilecodec::mvt::decode_polygons`'s `[polygon][ring]` output
//! and [`super::earcut`]'s single flat array plus hole offsets. Fill vertices carry
//! position only — colour is a per-draw push constant, since a style layer is one
//! colour by definition and per-vertex colour would quadruple the vertex buffer for
//! nothing.
//!
//! # Why the rings are regrouped before they reach earcut
//!
//! Earcut's model is one exterior ring plus holes that are inside it and disjoint from
//! each other. The published archive does not honour that. Its z0 ocean polygon carries
//! 105 holes of which 40 overlap another hole, 6 straddle the exterior boundary, 4 lie
//! wholly outside it, and 13 are lakes nested *inside* a continent hole. Handing that
//! straight to earcut is what produced the fan of slivers over the Arctic: a bridged ring
//! that self-intersects has no ears, so clipping stalls, the split-and-retry fallback
//! fires dozens of times, and it emits triangles that span the polygon. The geometry is
//! only 0.0016 of the tile wrong; the tessellation came out 0.089 wrong — 12% of the tile
//! painted blue over land.
//!
//! So [`polygons`] rebuilds the ring nesting the way the fill rules define it: a ring at
//! even nesting depth is an exterior, a ring at odd depth is a hole of the ring that
//! encloses it most closely, and each exterior is tessellated separately. That alone fixes
//! the nested lakes, which earcut has no way to express. The remaining conflicts — a hole
//! that crosses its own exterior, or two holes that overlap — cannot be expressed either,
//! and those holes are dropped, largest first so the biggest island survives. Filling in a
//! small island costs far less area than the slivers do.
//!
//! Earcut itself now matches upstream v2.2.4 exactly and is deliberately kept that way, so
//! it can still be diffed against the reference; nothing here works around a defect in it.
//!
//! The invalid geometry very likely originates in our own tile build, which clips each
//! ring independently — see `scripts/maps`. The renderer has to cope with the archive that
//! exists regardless.
