//! Device memory and the buffers geometry lives in.
//!
//! # Host-visible vertex buffers, and no staging copies
//!
//! On a desktop GPU you upload through a staging buffer because device memory is across
//! a PCIe bus. Mobile GPUs are **unified memory** — Adreno and Mali both expose memory
//! that is `DEVICE_LOCAL | HOST_VISIBLE` — so the vertex data can be written straight
//! into the buffer the GPU reads, and the staging buffer, its allocation, the copy
//! command and the barrier all disappear.
//!
//! That matters here more than usual: tiles arrive continuously while panning, so an
//! upload happens several times a second, and the plan expects the CPU to be the
//! bottleneck.
