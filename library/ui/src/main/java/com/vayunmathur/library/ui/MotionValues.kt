/**
 * The animated values a screen needs, on the theme's motion scheme.
 *
 * Companion to [Motion], which names durations and curves: these name the *interactions* that were
 * being rebuilt by hand at each call site. Screens reach for these rather than
 * `animate*AsState`/`animateItem` directly, which is also what keeps compose-animation out of the
 * app modules - a spec written at a call site carries no intent, and the ones written with no spec
 * at all silently took Compose's own default rather than the scheme this app is themed with.
 *
 * Every spec here is a scheme spring, which is right for a state change *within* a screen: a spring
 * is interruptible from wherever it has got to, so a second tap does not have to wait out the first.
 * Anything driven by a predictive-back gesture needs a duration instead, and lives in
 * `com.vayunmathur.library.util` with the navigation transitions.
