/**
 * Title alignment for [AppScaffold].
 *
 * A real design choice rather than an inconsistency, so it stays a per-screen
 * decision: [Start] is the workhorse for content screens, [Center] suits
 * single-purpose or top-level screens. What [AppScaffold] fixes is that
 * choosing between them used to mean writing the whole scaffold out again.

/**
 * How tall [AppScaffold]'s top bar is, and so how much presence its title has.
 *
 * [Small] is the default and stays the default deliberately: it is what all 39 modules using
 * [AppScaffold] already render, and the taller bars change every screen's vertical rhythm.
 * The two flexible sizes are the Expressive two-row bars - they collapse to a single row as
 * content scrolls under them, and are worth opting into on a screen whose title is the screen's
 * identity rather than a label above content. [LargeFlexible] treats the title as the headline;
 * [MediumFlexible] is the middle ground.
 *
 * A flexible size only collapses because [AppScaffold] feeds its `scrollBehavior` nested-scroll
 * deltas; pair one with [appBarScrollBehavior] and the bar behaves.

/**
 * Scaffold for an ordinary screen: a top app bar with an optional back button,

 *
 * Fifty-five files had written out the same `Scaffold` + `TopAppBar` +
 * `IconNavigation(backStack)` by hand. [ListPage] already covers list screens;
 * this is for everything else.
 *
 * The content lambda receives the scaffold's [PaddingValues] and must apply
 * them - it is not applied here so that a screen can let a list scroll under
 * the bars while still insetting its own items.
 *
 * [scrollBehavior] is required rather than defaulted so that every screen states how its bar
 * reacts to scrolling; [appBarScrollBehavior] gives the right one for a [size].
