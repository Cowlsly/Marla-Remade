/**
 * Shared on-device OCR engine using Baidu **PP-OCRv5 mobile**, running on the Vulkan
 * compute runtime in `:library:ml`.
 *
 * Detection is DBNet over a PP-HGNetV2 backbone; recognition is a PP-LCNetV3 backbone into a
 * two-block transformer with a CTC head. Both are converted ahead of time to `.vkml` by
 * `scripts/ml/ppocr_fold.py` and shipped in this module's assets. The recogniser is the
 * **latin** model (836-char dict covering 47 Latin-script languages; no CJK) for a much
 * smaller footprint.
 *
 * # What replaced what
 *
 * This used to call into the `com.github.vayun-mathur:ncnn-android` AAR, where the whole
 * detect-crop-recognise pipeline lived inside `ppocrv5.cpp` and could not be read or tested.
 * All of it is now Rust in `:library:ml`: the DBNet post-processing in `post::dbnet`, the
 * rotated crop in `post::crop`, the CTC collapse in `post::ctc`, and the sequencing in
 * `post::ocr` - each host-tested against values computed by hand, and both models checked
 * numerically against onnxruntime by `scripts/ml/onnx_parity.py`.
 *
 * The engine still adapts the result to the [OcrResult]/[TextBox] shape consumers expect.
 * Reading order is decided natively now, so this no longer sorts.
 *
 * If Vulkan fp16 compute or an asset is unavailable the engine is inert (returns empty text,
 * never crashes) - call [isAvailable] to check up front.
 *
 * All heavy work runs off the main thread (Dispatchers.Default). Instances are safe to reuse
 * sequentially; concurrent calls are serialised internally.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * val ocr = OcrEngine(context)
 * val text = ocr.recognize(bitmap)   // suspend
 * ocr.close()                        // when done with a batch
 * ```

     * quad, so they stay meaningful for consumers that only need a rect.
     * [vertical] marks a region read as vertical script (stacked glyphs).
