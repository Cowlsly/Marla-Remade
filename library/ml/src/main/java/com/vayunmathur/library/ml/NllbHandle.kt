/**
 * On-device translation between any two of 202 languages: NLLB-200-distilled-600M on the
 * Vulkan compute runtime.
 *
 * NLLB distilled to 600M parameters: 12 encoder layers, 12 decoder layers, `d_model` 1024,
 * 16 heads, a 4096-wide ReLU feed-forward - and a 256,206-entry vocabulary shared between
 * the input embedding and the output projection. **Direct** translation, with no English
 * pivot, so every pair is a single hop. See `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/nets/nllb.rs`.
 *
 * # Two files, downloaded rather than bundled
 *
 * `nllb600.maml` and `tokenizer.bin`, which are far too much to ship inside an APK - hence
 * [inDirectory] and no asset path. The tied embedding is emitted as four head-split tensors
 * over disjoint class ranges (256,206 classes at 1024 channels exceeds
 * `maxStorageBufferRange` in one buffer), and the tokenizer table holds the 256,000
 * SentencePiece pieces plus the 202 flores language tokens.
 *
 * This replaces the old SMaLL-100 build (12 enc + 3 dec, 128,112 vocab).
 *
 * # Both language tokens are required
 *
 * NLLB puts the **source** language token on the encoder source and forces the **target**
 * language token as the decoder's first token (forced-BOS), rather than SMaLL-100's
 * target-token-on-source + EOS-start. Backwards, it produces fluent output in the wrong
 * language rather than an error - which is why [translate] takes flores codes rather than
 * bare ids and resolves both through
 * [com.vayunmathur.translate.platform.NllbModel.tokenId].
 *
 * # Normalisation
 *
 * The model's normaliser is `nmt_nfkc` with a precompiled charsmap, so [translate] applies
 * `java.text.Normalizer` **NFKC** first and native does the rest - the same split
 * [SupertonicSynthesizer] uses for NFD.
 *
 * # Availability
 *
 * Construction never throws. [isAvailable] is false when `libmodelrunner.so` is missing
 * for this ABI, when either file is absent or malformed, or when the device cannot give
 * us a Vulkan device with fp16 compute - and then [translate] returns null.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe, and more sharply than the other handles here: a translation re-records
 * the network once per decoded token, so two concurrent calls would interleave recordings
 * of the same command buffer. A caller must hold a lock across [translate] and [close].
