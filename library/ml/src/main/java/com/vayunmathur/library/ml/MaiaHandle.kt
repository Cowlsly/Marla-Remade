/**
 * On-device human-move prediction for chess: Maia3-5M on the Vulkan compute runtime.
 *
 * An encoder-only transformer over 64 square tokens — width 256, 8 blocks, 8 heads — at 5.23
 * million parameters. See `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/nets/maia.rs`.
 *
 * # It predicts, it does not search
 *
 * One forward pass per move and no tree at all, which is the point rather than a compromise.
 * Maia3 is trained on human games to predict what a player *of a given rating* would play, so
 * a weak setting blunders the way a beginner does. It replaces Stockfish at `Skill Level 0`,
 * which searched eight ply and then threw a move away in ways no human ever does.
 *
 * # Strength is an input
 *
 * [logits] takes `selfElo` and `oppoElo` in 0..5000 — clamped, not rejected — and they enter
 * the model as a blend of two learned embeddings. One weights file therefore covers every
 * difficulty; there is nothing to reload when the player changes it.
 *
 * # One bundled asset, 6.8 MiB
 *
 * `maia3-5m.maml` ships inside the APK, so this has an [inAssets] and no download. Every
 * convolution is int8, quantised per output channel from the fp32 checkpoint; the norms, the
 * biases and the two elo embeddings stay fp16 and are 1% of the parameters. It replaces an
 * 86 MB NNUE, so the APK is about 79 MB smaller.
 *
 * int8 rather than fp16 because it was measured: `scripts/ml/maia_quant_eval.py` puts move
 * agreement against fp32 at 99.0% to 99.5% across the four difficulties, and every
 * disagreement is a position where the top two legal moves are closer together than fp16
 * rounding alone would separate them. The same harness rejects int4 at 87% to 91%.
 *
 * An asset must be stored **uncompressed** for this to work at all: `AssetManager.openFd`
 * throws for a deflated entry. That is what `noCompress += "maml"` in
 * `games/chess/build.gradle.kts` is for.
 *
 * # The caller owns the chess
 *
 * [logits] returns the raw 4352-entry move vector. Legal masking, temperature and sampling all
 * need a legal move list, which this library has no idea how to produce — `MaiaEngine` in
 * `:games:chess` does all three, and also does the mirror-and-swap that [logits] requires for
 * black.
 *
 * # Availability
 *
 * Construction never throws. [isAvailable] is false when `libmodelrunner.so` is missing for
 * this ABI, when the asset is absent, compressed or malformed, or when the device cannot give
 * us a Vulkan device with fp16 compute — and then [logits] returns null. The chess app gates
 * its "play against the AI" option on it rather than offering a mode that cannot move.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe. A caller must hold a lock across [logits] and [close].

     * are always rank 7 to rank 8, because the board is mirrored for black.
