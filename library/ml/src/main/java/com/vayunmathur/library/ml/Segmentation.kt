/**
 * The safe half of the JNI surface: a network handle with a lifetime.
 *
 * `internal`, and held by composition rather than inherited from, so the public API of
 * this module is exactly [SelfieSegmenter] and [SubjectSegmenter] with three members each
 * — Kotlin would otherwise force this type public to let a public class extend it.
 *
 * # Failure is a state, not an exception
 *
 * The constructor never throws. If `libmodelrunner.so` is missing, or the device has no
 * Vulkan fp16 compute, or the asset will not parse, [isAvailable] is false and [segment]
 * returns null — the graceful-degradation shape `GpuStitcher` uses in `:camera`. That is
 * the GPU-only decision made visible: there is no CPU fallback, so the feature turns off
 * and the caller keeps whatever it had.
 *
 * # Not thread-safe, on purpose
 *
 * [segment] and [close] must not overlap. `BokehAnalyzer` holds `synchronized(lock)`
 * across the whole native call for exactly this reason — its comments record a real
 * `SEGV_MTESERR` use-after-free where `close` destroyed the net while worker threads were
 * still reading it. A `VkDevice` handle has the identical hazard, so putting a lock in
 * here as well would be a second, redundant one; the discipline stays where the threading
 * actually is.
