/**
 * Gemma 4's vision tower: an image in, the soft tokens the decoder reads in its place.
 *
 * Restores the image input that `com.google.ai.edge.litertlm` used to provide. [Gemma4Handle] is
 * text-only; this produces the `[n, 1536]` block that stands in for an image in its prompt, and
 * [Gemma4Handle.generate] splices it in.
 *
 * # A separate file and a separate handle
 *
 * The tower is its own `.maml` with its own graph id, downloaded separately. A device that never
 * sends an image never fetches it, and a tower that fails to load leaves the assistant answering
 * text rather than taking it down.
 *
 * # The resize is here, the size is not
 *
 * Bitmap work belongs on the platform, as it does for `ClipEmbedder`. But the target size is the
 * reference preprocessor's aspect-ratio-preserving fit to a patch budget, and being one 48-pixel
 * block out changes how many soft tokens come back - so [MlNative.gemma4VisionSize] decides and
 * [encode] obeys.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe. A new aspect ratio re-records the plan, so two concurrent encodes would race
 * on the recording.
