/**
 * Google's always-on music gate, ported to the CPU.
 *
 * The cheap half of Now Playing. Feed it microphone PCM and it answers "is this music?"
 * once every 10 ms, from 8,200 int8 parameters. [NnfpHandle] is the other half - the
 * expensive fingerprinter you only run once this has said yes - and the two are different
 * networks with different shapes, not two entry points to one model.
 *
 * # Not on the GPU, unlike everything else here
 *
 * Every other handle in this package dispatches Vulkan compute. This does not, and so it
 * has no asset, no file descriptor and no device: [inProcess] cannot fail for want of
 * hardware. At 100 Hz over ~8,200 multiply-accumulates the arithmetic is microseconds,
 * while a GPU dispatch would be 100 submit/fence/readback round trips a second on a
 * workload whose whole point is being cheap enough to leave running. Google ships it on a
 * DSP for the same reason.
 *
 * # Streaming, and the warm-up
 *
 * Stateful: six four-deep circular buffers carry 230 ms of context between calls, so
 * scores depend on everything pushed since the last [reset]. The first ~23 hops after a
 * reset are computed from cold buffers, so they are withheld rather than reported - a
 * [push] can legitimately return nothing at all. A caller starting a fresh listening
 * session must [reset] or its first scores describe the previous session's audio.
 *
 * # Not thread-safe
 *
 * One [push] at a time, and no [push] concurrent with [close]. Hold a lock across both.
 *
 * # What this is not
 *
 * It is not a reproduction of Google's shipped behaviour. The network and its
 * quantization are recovered exactly, but two links in the chain are inferences - the
 * sigmoid reading of the model's int16 score, and the smoothing inside the latching
 * classifier - and the runtime threshold overrides in `music_detector.descriptor` are
 * unrecoverable, because that file is a symbol and byte-offset table with no values in
 * it. Treat the probabilities as a well-founded signal to tune against, not as ground
 * truth. See `detector/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 3.
