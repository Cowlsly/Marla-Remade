/**
 * On-device image and text embedding in a shared 512-d space: TinyCLIP on the Vulkan compute
 * runtime.
 *
 * Two transformers of width 256 with 4 heads of 64 — a 10-layer vision tower over 16x16 patches of a
 * 224x224 image, and a 3-layer causal text tower over up to 77 tokens — at 23.4 million parameters.
 * See `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/nets/tinyclip.rs`.
 *
 * # One bundled asset, 22.6 MiB
 *
 * `tinyclip.maml` ships inside the APK, so this has an [inAssets] and no download. Everything but
 * the layer norms, the biases, the class token and the two position tables is int8, quantised per
 * output channel from the fp32 export; the worst per-tensor correlation against fp32 is 0.99986.
 *
 * It replaces `onnxruntime-android` running a 24 MB int8 ONNX export of the same model, and is
 * *closer* to the fp32 reference than that was — 0.9994 against 0.9829 on a text query, because the
 * export quantised the 49,408-row token table per tensor with a zero point. The APK loses 10.5 MB of
 * arm64 `.so`, not weights.
 *
 * An asset must be stored **uncompressed** for this to work at all: `AssetManager.openFd` throws for
 * a deflated entry. That is what `noCompress += "maml"` in `photos/build.gradle.kts` is for, and it
 * costs nothing on download size since int8 weights barely compress.
 *
 * # The two towers share one net
 *
 * They share no weights, but they do share the file, so both run through one handle and native
 * re-records between them. Switching costs a `device_wait_idle`; an indexing run is [imageEmbedding]
 * throughout and pays for one.
 *
 * # Neither vector is normalised
 *
 * [imageEmbedding] and [textEmbedding] return the raw projection. The caller normalises — in
 * `:photos` that is `ClipEmbedder.l2Normalize`, so the stored BLOB format is decided in one place.
 *
 * # Availability
 *
 * Construction never throws. [isAvailable] is false when `libmodelrunner.so` is missing for this
 * ABI, when the asset is absent, compressed or malformed, or when the device cannot give us a Vulkan
 * device with fp16 compute — and then both embedding calls return null.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe. A text query re-records the network, so two concurrent calls would interleave
 * recordings of the same command buffer. A caller must hold a lock across the embedding calls and
 * [close].
