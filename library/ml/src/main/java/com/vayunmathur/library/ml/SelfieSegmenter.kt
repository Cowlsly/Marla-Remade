/**
 * Person-versus-background segmentation, for `:camera`'s portrait bokeh.
 *
 * **MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation** (Apache-2.0), run on Vulkan compute at 256×256 with
 * fp16 weights. See `camera/src/main/assets/README.md` for provenance and
 * `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/nets/selfie.rs` for the forward pass.
 *
 * Replaces `com.vayunmathur.ncnn.PortraitSegmenter` and its `erdnet` model, which shipped
 * with no upstream URL, license or conversion recipe. This is a different model rather
 * than a port of that one, so its masks differ.
 *
 * GPU-only: if [isAvailable] is false the device has no Vulkan fp16 compute and [segment]
 * returns null, which callers treat as "no mask" rather than as an error.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: [segment] and [close] must not overlap.
 *
 * @param context used only to read the asset; not retained.
 * @param assetName the `.vkml` in the app's assets.
