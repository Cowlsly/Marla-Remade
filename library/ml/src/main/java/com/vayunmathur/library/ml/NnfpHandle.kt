/**
 * On-device audio fingerprinting: the Now Playing embedding network on the Vulkan compute
 * runtime.
 *
 * Ten alternating frequency and time convolutions over a 32-bin log-mel spectrogram, then a
 * depthwise head, at 172,576 parameters. [embed] turns 4.8 seconds of microphone audio into 64
 * numbers that identify what is playing. See `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/nets/nnfp.rs`.
 *
 * # It describes, it does not decide
 *
 * The embedding is a *descriptor*, not an answer. Matching it against a song database, deciding
 * whether the match is good enough, and pooling several windows into one query are all the
 * caller's, because none of them are in the model. In particular the vector is **not
 * normalised**: whether to compare by cosine, by L2 or through a product quantiser could not be
 * recovered from the model, so this does not invent a convention.
 *
 * # The front end is native too
 *
 * [embed] takes raw PCM, not features. The log-mel front end — a periodic Hann window, a
 * 512-point transform, a 32-channel mel bank over 60–3800 Hz — runs inside the same call, so
 * there is no feature-extraction step in Kotlin to keep in sync with the network it feeds. See
 * `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/microfrontend.rs`, which is written against a config rather
 * than against this model, so another audio net can reuse it.
 *
 * # No state, so no warm-up
 *
 * The model was exported as a *streaming* graph, evaluated once per 10 ms with six circular
 * buffers carrying state between calls. That is unrolled here into a fixed [WINDOW_SAMPLES]
 * window, which is the whole receptive field. So [embed] is a pure function: two calls with the
 * same samples give the same 64 numbers, there is nothing to prime, and dropping a window
 * corrupts nothing.
 *
 * Callers step a ring buffer forward by whatever hop they like, but note the window is 4.8 s:
 * advancing by one 10 ms frame gives a 99.8% overlapping window and almost the same embedding.
 * Something on the order of half a second to a second is the useful range.
 *
 * # Fidelity
 *
 * The weights are dequantised from the export's int8 to fp16, because at this size int8 would
 * save nine kilobytes and cost accuracy. The consequence worth knowing: this is a float
 * evaluation of a network trained quantisation-aware, and it has **not** been compared against
 * the original runtime — only against an independently computed reference for the front end.
 * Treat embeddings as self-consistent within this implementation rather than interchangeable
 * with any produced elsewhere.
 *
 * # One bundled asset, 340 KiB
 *
 * `nnfp.maml` ships inside the APK, so this has an [inAssets] and no download. An asset must be
 * stored **uncompressed** for this to work at all: `AssetManager.openFd` throws for a deflated
 * entry. That is what `noCompress += "maml"` in the app's `build.gradle.kts` is for.
 *
 * # Availability
 *
 * Construction never throws. [isAvailable] is false when `libmodelrunner.so` is missing for
 * this ABI, when the asset is absent, compressed or malformed, or when the device cannot give
 * us a Vulkan device with fp16 compute — and then [embed] returns null. Gate the feature on it
 * rather than offering recognition that cannot run.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe. A caller must hold a lock across [embed] and [close].
