/**
 * General salient-object detection, for `:photos`'s auto-select-subject.
 *
 * **U²-Net portable** (Apache-2.0), run on Vulkan compute at 320×320 with fp16 weights.
 * Unlike [SelfieSegmenter] it is not person-specific: it predicts a per-pixel saliency map
 * and so picks out arbitrary subjects. See `photos/src/main/assets/README.md` for
 * provenance and `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/nets/u2netp.rs` for the forward pass.
 *
 * Replaces `com.vayunmathur.ncnn.Segmenter`. Same network, re-sourced from a licensed ONNX
 * export — the ncnn model's op inventory matched it exactly — so masks should look the
 * same as before, unlike `:camera`'s.
 *
 * Its activation arena is 76 MiB of device memory, so [close] it when the editor session
 * ends rather than holding it for the life of the process.
 *
 * GPU-only: if [isAvailable] is false the device has no Vulkan fp16 compute and [segment]
 * returns null, which the caller treats as "no subject found".
 *
 * Not thread-safe: [segment] and [close] must not overlap.
 *
 * @param context used only to read the asset; not retained.
 * @param assetName the `.maml` in the app's assets.
