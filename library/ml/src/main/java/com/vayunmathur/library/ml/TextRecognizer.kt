/**
 * On-device text recognition: PP-OCRv5 mobile detection and recognition on Vulkan compute.
 *
 * Replaces the ncnn PP-OCR path. The detector is DBNet over a PP-HGNetV2 backbone and the
 * recogniser is a PP-LCNetV3 backbone into a two-block transformer with a CTC head, both
 * converted to `.vkml` by `scripts/ml/ppocr_fold.py`. The recogniser is the **latin** model
 * - 836 characters covering Latin-script languages, no CJK - which is what keeps it under
 * 4 MB.
 *
 * Everything between the two networks happens natively: the rotated crop out of each
 * detected quad, the CTC collapse, and reading order. So [recognize] crosses the JNI
 * boundary once per bitmap rather than once per line.
 *
 * # Availability
 *
 * The constructor never throws. [isAvailable] is false when `libmodelrunner.so` is missing
 * for this ABI, when an asset is absent, or when the device cannot give us a Vulkan device
 * with fp16 compute - and then [recognize] returns an empty list. Vulkan 1.1 with
 * `shaderFloat16` is available across the minSdk 31 fleet, so this is a guard rather than
 * an expected path.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe, and holding a lock across the whole of [recognize] and [close] is
 * required rather than advisable: the native handle is freed by [close] and reading it
 * afterwards is a use-after-free. See `BokehAnalyzer`, whose comments record what that
 * looked like when it happened.
 *
 * Not cheap to construct either - two nets, two arenas, two command buffers - so build one
 * per batch of images and [close] it, rather than one per image.
