/**
 * On-device text-to-speech: Supertonic 3 on the Vulkan compute runtime.
 *
 * One bundle covers 31 languages and 10 voices, and every one of the four networks runs on the GPU.
 * All four are checked numerically against onnxruntime — see
 * `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/nets/supertonic_*.rs`:
 *
 * - **Duration predictor** returns one number, the utterance's length in seconds, which fixes
 *   every later shape.
 * - **Text encoder** turns the characters into a `[256, chars]` conditioning.
 * - **Flow-matching sampler** is the expensive one: 16 steps, each running two guidance branches,
 *   so 32 passes of 64 million parameters for one sentence.
 * - **ConvNeXt vocoder** turns the latent into 44,100 Hz samples.
 *
 * # There is no phonemiser
 *
 * The front end is a flat 65,536-entry codepoint table, not espeak-ng, so nothing has to be
 * generated per language on the build machine. The model does expect **NFD**-decomposed text,
 * which [synthesize] does itself through `java.text.Normalizer`: precomposed accents are unmapped
 * while combining marks are first-class tokens, so skipping it would quietly drop characters.
 *
 * # Two places the bundle can live
 *
 * [inAssets] reads it out of the APK and [inDirectory] out of a folder on disk. Both go to native
 * as **file descriptors** rather than byte arrays, which is not an optimisation: reading the weights
 * into a `ByteArray` allocates them three times over — the Java array, the copy JNI hands Rust, and
 * the reader's own — so a bundle of this size would need several hundred megabytes of transient
 * heap and be killed for it on a low-RAM device. Native reads each file's header and tensor table,
 * a few kilobytes, then streams the weights into the GPU a chunk at a time.
 *
 * An asset must be stored **uncompressed** for this to work at all: `AssetManager.openFd` throws
 * for a deflated entry. That is what `noCompress += "maml"` in the app's Gradle configuration is
 * for, and it costs nothing on download size since fp16 and int8 weights barely compress.
 *
 * # Voices
 *
 * A voice is two small style tensors, not a model, so [voice] switches without re-uploading
 * anything: all ten come to ~250 KB together.
 *
 * # Availability
 *
 * Construction never throws. [isAvailable] is false when `libmodelrunner.so` is missing for
 * this ABI, when a file is absent, or when the device cannot give us a Vulkan device with fp16
 * compute — and then [synthesize] returns an empty array.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe. A caller must hold a lock across [synthesize], [voice] and [close]: the handle
 * is freed by [close] and reading it afterwards is a use-after-free.
