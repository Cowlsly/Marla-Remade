//! Reports the three device limits a `.maml` file has to fit inside, and finds the largest
//! single device-local allocation that actually succeeds.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --offline -p modelrunner --example probe_limits
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `modelrunner::vulkan::run` puts the **entire** weights data section into one
//! `Buffer::device_local`, so a model is bounded by `maxMemoryAllocationSize` and not merely by
//! how much memory the device has. `maxStorageBufferRange` is handled by
//! `modelrunner::vulkan::segment`, which windows the *descriptor*; nothing windows the
//! *allocation*. The largest file the runtime loads today is NLLB at 617 MB, comfortably under
//! the 1 GiB the spec guarantees, so the ceiling has never been approached and never measured.
//!
//! A reported limit and a limit that works are different things — a driver may advertise a
//! number it cannot honour once the heap is shared with a compositor — so this asks the device
//! for the number *and* then tries the allocation.
//!
//! # Reading the result on a desktop GPU
//!
//! A discrete card with its own VRAM will report and satisfy allocations far beyond anything a
//! phone will. This probe can therefore **rule a model out** but never rule one in: a failure
//! here is conclusive, a success here says nothing about an Adreno or Mali part sharing system
//! RAM with the rest of Android. Run it on the target handset before believing it.
