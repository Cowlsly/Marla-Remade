//! Runs Gemma 4's audio tower on the GPU and compares it with onnxruntime's.
//!
//! ```text
//! python scripts/ml/gemma4_audio_encoder_parity.py audio_encoder_fp16.onnx -o audio_golden.json
//! cargo run --offline --release -p modelrunner --example check_gemma4_audio_parity -- \
//!     gemma4_audio.maml audio_golden.json
//! ```
//!
//! # What only this catches
//!
//! Until this existed the audio tower had never executed on a GPU in any form. `nets::gemma4_audio`
//! has twenty unit tests and `vulkan::parity` has ten for the banded ops, and all of them pass —
//! but the unit tests check that 747 tensors are declared in the order the converter writes them,
//! and the parity tests check one op against its own oracle. Both are satisfied by a tower whose
//! twelve layers are composed wrongly.
//!
//! # The int4 control is the bar, and it is not optional
//!
//! The device runs int4 weights and the export runs fp16 ones, so the two cannot agree closely.
//! Measured by the generator, four bits alone cost this much cosine at the output:
//!
//! ```text
//! T = 1   0.009    T = 25  0.017    T = 48  0.041
//! T = 4   0.002    T = 56  0.037
//! ```
//!
//! So against the exact reference a *correct* tower reads anywhere from 0.998 to 0.958 depending
//! only on how long the clip is, and no fixed floor exists that anyone could set. The control's
//! value is not that it widens the gap — it is that it makes the correct answer a CONSTANT. Every
//! comparison below is against `_int4` when the golden carries it.
//!
//! # The per-probe bar, which I expected not to exist
//!
//! The plan was to print the profile unthresholded, on the reasoning that fp16 Vulkan against
//! fp32 onnxruntime must drift with depth and no floor could be both tight enough to localise and
//! loose enough to pass. The first device run disproved that: the drift across twelve layers is
//! two parts in a million, against negative controls three orders of magnitude further out. So
//! [`PROBE_FLOOR`] is real and measured, not assumed.
