//! Detection, cropping, recognition and reading order — the whole OCR request.
//!
//! # Why this is not in `bridge.rs`
//!
//! Everything between the two networks is arithmetic on tens of candidates: threshold the
//! probability map, take each region's oriented rectangle, warp a strip out of the source,
//! collapse the logits, sort the results. None of it touches Vulkan, and all of it is the
//! part that used to live inside the ncnn fork's `ppocrv5.cpp` where it could not be read
//! or tested.
//!
//! So recognition arrives as a **closure**. [`lines`] takes a probability map and a way to
//! turn a crop into logits, which means the sequencing is exercised on the host against a
//! stub recogniser, and `bridge.rs` supplies the real one. The alternative — a function
//! that owns two `Net`s — would be untestable anywhere but a device.
//!
//! # The two fixed shapes
//!
//! Detection runs at a fixed 960x960 square and recognition at a fixed 48x[`REC_WIDTH`], so
//! one compiled plan serves every request. `vulkan::run::Net` records its command buffer
//! once at construction, so a per-image shape would mean compiling a plan and re-recording
//! per request; PaddleOCR pads to a batch's shape for the same reason.
//!
//! The cost is padding. A tall thin photograph wastes detection work on the letterbox, and
//! a short word wastes recognition work on the right of its strip — which is why
//! [`super::ctc::decode`] is told how many timesteps are real.
