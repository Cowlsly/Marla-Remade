//! SCRFD's post-processing: anchor decode, non-maximum suppression, and undoing the
//! letterbox.
//!
//! # Why this is host code and not a shader
//!
//! The plan stops at [`crate::nets::scrfd`]'s nine convolution outputs. What follows is
//! a threshold, a sort and a quadratic pairwise comparison over however many proposals
//! survived — data-dependent control flow over a handful of candidates, which is the
//! shape of work a GPU is worst at and a CPU finishes in microseconds.
//!
//! # Ported from `scrfd.cpp`, including its quirks
//!
//! Every constant and every rounding decision below is `scrfd.cpp:144-224` and
//! `:389-443`. Three are worth calling out because they look like mistakes:
//!
//! * **Anchor centres are `j * stride`, with no half-cell offset.** The reference builds
//!   a table of anchor boxes and then uses only its row *count*: `distance2bbox` needs
//!   the centre, and the centre is `anchor[0] + j * stride + anchor_w / 2`, in which the
//!   `anchor_w / 2` cancels the `-anchor_w / 2` that `anchor[0]` is. So the box geometry
//!   is independent of the anchor sizes, and this port does not compute them at all.
//!   ([`ANCHORS`] is still 2, because the score map has two channels.)
//! * **Box extents carry an inclusive `+1`.** The reference sets
//!   `width = x1 - x0 + 1`, so a box is a pixel wider and taller than
//!   `distance2bbox` produced. That inflation is then *kept* through NMS and through the
//!   undo, so it changes which detections survive. It is preserved here.
//! * **The letterbox offset is subtracted as an integer.** `wpad / 2` is integer
//!   division in C++, and using the true half of an odd pad would shift every
//!   coordinate by half a pixel.
//!
//! # One deliberate difference
//!
//! The reference sorts with a quicksort, which is unstable, so proposals with equal
//! scores come out in an arbitrary order and NMS then keeps an arbitrary one of them.
//! [`suppress`] sorts stably, so equal scores keep the order they were decoded in. That
//! makes this port *more* deterministic than the thing it replaces, and it is the reason
//! a bit-identical comparison against ncnn can differ on a tie.
