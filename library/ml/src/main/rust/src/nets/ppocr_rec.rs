//! PP-OCRv5 mobile text recognition: a PP-LCNetV3 backbone into a small transformer.
//!
//! # The shape of it
//!
//! A line crop comes in at `3 x 48 x W`. Thirty-three convolutions reduce it to
//! `480 x 3 x W/8`, one average pool with an asymmetric window collapses the last three
//! rows and halves the width again, and what comes out is `480 x 1 x W/8` — a sequence of
//! `T = W/8` positions. Two pre-norm transformer blocks run over that, the result is
//! concatenated back onto the pooled features, and a final `1x1` emits
//! [`crate::post::ctc::LOGITS`] logits per position for a CTC decode.
//!
//! Height is **fixed** at [`HEIGHT`] rather than being a parameter, and that is not a
//! simplification. Four layers carry a vertical stride of 2 (48 → 24 → 12 → 6 → 3) and
//! the pool's kernel height is exactly 3, so the whole vertical path is a chain of
//! constants that only closes at 48. A different height would need a different pool.
//!
//! # It is folded, like detection
//!
//! Same export shape as `ppocr_det`, same `scripts/ml/ppocr_fold.py`: every convolution
//! arrives as `Conv → Mul(scalar) → Add(scalar) → HardSigmoid(1/6) → Mul(self) →
//! Mul(scalar) → Add(scalar)`, and all of the constant part folds into the weight and
//! bias ahead of time. So every layer here is a convolution with a fused activation, and
//! [`TENSORS`] is exactly twice the layer count.
//!
//! The recogniser adds three things detection did not have, and each is the reason a
//! pipeline exists:
//!
//! * **Swish**, `x * sigmoid(x)`, seven times — spelled `Mul(x, Sigmoid(x))` in the
//!   export and recognised by the fold the way `HardSwish` is. Not interchangeable with
//!   `HardSwish`, which this same graph also uses 31 times.
//! * **Layer norm over the channel axis**, five times, four at epsilon `1e-5` and the
//!   last at `1e-6`.
//! * **Attention**, twice, at [`D_MODEL`] 120 in [`HEADS`] 8.
//!
//! # Why there is no permute anywhere
//!
//! The sequence is `[d_model, 1, T]` — the layout the backbone already produces. The ncnn
//! conversion of this same model has to `Reshape` and `Permute` into `[T, d_model]` before
//! its `LayerNorm`, and back again afterwards, four times. Here both are no-ops and are
//! simply not transcribed:
//!
//! * Every projection — the eleven in the two blocks, plus the classifier — is a `1x1`
//!   convolution over channels.
//! * Splitting `d_model` into heads is free, because `[120, 1, T]` read as `[8, 15, T]`
//!   is the same bytes in the same order.
//!
//! See [`super::Kind::LayerNorm`] for the full argument and [`super::Kind::AttnScores`]
//! for what the attention pipelines do with it.
//!
//! # The output is raw logits, class-major
//!
//! The export ends in a `Softmax` over the 838 classes. That is **not** transcribed: the
//! output here is `[LOGITS, 1, T]`, unnormalised, and
//! [`crate::post::ctc::decode`] takes it from there.
//!
//! Two reasons. The layout is one: a softmax over classes in this layout reduces over
//! channels, and the result would still be class-major while a CTC decode wants one row
//! per timestep — so a transpose on the host is unavoidable either way. The other is that
//! the decode does not need the distribution at all. It needs the argmax, which a softmax
//! cannot change, and the winner's probability, which is `1 / sum(exp(x - max))` from the
//! raw logits directly. So the pass is not merely moved to the host, it is deleted.
