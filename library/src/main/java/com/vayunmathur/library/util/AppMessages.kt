/**
 * App-wide channel for transient messages, drained by `MainNavigation` onto
 * the snackbar.
 *
 * Exists because Toast is banned (see the `ToastUsage` lint check) and the
 * obvious replacement, a snackbar, needs a composition to live in. Plenty of
 * the places that need to say something - a ViewModel finishing a save, a
 * worker reporting a failure - have no composition and often no Context
 * either. Rather than thread a callback down to each of them, they post here
 * and whichever screen is on top shows it.
 *
 * Replay is zero and the buffer drops oldest: a message posted while no screen
 * is listening is gone rather than queued to ambush the next screen that
 * opens. Anything that must survive that - a completed download, a failed
 * sync - is a notification, not a transient message.
