/**
 * Restarts the periodic check after a boot or an update to this app.
 *
 * `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED` matters as much as `BOOT_COMPLETED`: replacing the APK puts the app
 * back into the stopped state and cancels its work, so without this the updater would quietly
 * stop checking the first time it updated itself.
 *
 * This deliberately does not start [com.vayunmathur.updater.service.UpdateInstallService]. A
 * boot receiver may not start a `specialUse` foreground service on Android 13 and 14, and there
 * is nothing urgent enough about an OTA to want it competing with everything else that runs at
 * boot. The worker scheduled here runs immediately and decides from there.
