 * Whether a background run may go ahead and pull an update down.

 * two gigabytes and downloading that over a phone plan without being asked is a real cost. It
 * has nothing to do with whether the update is trustworthy; that question is settled by the
 * signature check, much later and unconditionally.

 * A manual "check now" from the UI does not come through here. The user asking for it is the
