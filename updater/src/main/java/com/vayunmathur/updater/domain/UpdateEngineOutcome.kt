/**
 * What an `onPayloadApplicationComplete(errorCode)` actually means.
 *
 * This exists because [android.os.UpdateEngine.applyPayload] does not report failure by
 * throwing. Success and failure arrive on the same callback, distinguished only by an int, so
 * code that wraps `applyPayload` in a try/catch and treats "no exception" as "applied" will
 * cheerfully reboot a device onto a slot that was never written. Classifying the int is the
 * only thing standing between those two outcomes, so it is pure and it is tested.
 *
 * The codes mirror `android.os.UpdateEngine.ErrorCodeConstants`. They are duplicated rather
 * than referenced because that class lives in a `compileOnly` stub: it is absent at unit-test
 * runtime, and Kotlin does not promise to inline a Java `static final` the way javac does, so
 * referencing it here would trade a testable classifier for a `NoClassDefFoundError`.
 * `analysis/diff_updateengine_stubs.sh` is what keeps the values honest.
 *
 * Only [SUCCESS] is load-bearing — every other code lands in [Failed] regardless of whether the
 * description below is the right one, so a stale entry costs a confusing message, not a bad
 * update.
