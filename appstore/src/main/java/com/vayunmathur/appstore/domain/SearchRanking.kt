 * Turns a query and a set of candidate listings into an order.
 *
 * The old ranking treated the query as one literal string, which is what issue #595 is
 * about: "Google Maps" only ever reached the `contains` tier, so everything Play returned
 * alongside the real answer — Facebook, Netflix — scored the same and sorted in
 * alphabetically, and "chase mobile" matched nothing at all even though it is the app's
 * exact name, because no single field holds those two words together.
 *
 * So the query is split into words. A result has to account for every one of them before
 * it is shown at all, and where it lands is decided by how the words line up with the
 * name rather than by whether the whole phrase happens to appear verbatim.
