/**
 * Every icon, folder, widget and pinned shortcut on the home screen, in one table.
 *
 * Deliberately polymorphic, mirroring Launcher3's `favorites`, rather than a table per
 * type. Items of all four kinds share a container/screen/cell/span identity, so every
 * placement query is type-agnostic; and drag-and-drop converts between types constantly
 * (an app becomes a folder child, a shortcut becomes a home item). Separate tables would
 * put a union in front of every read and a cross-table move behind every drop.
 *
 * The target is stored as [packageName] + [className] + [profileSerial] rather than a
 * serialized Intent URI. That makes it queryable — orphan cleanup and reconciliation are
 * `WHERE` clauses instead of a full scan and parse of every row — and it round-trips
 * through `LauncherApps`/`UserManager` without losing the user. [profileSerial] is the
 * `UserManager` serial number because a `UserHandle` is not stable across reboots.
