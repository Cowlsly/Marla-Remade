 * routes: they are overlays inside [com.vayunmathur.launcher.ui.HomeContent], because a drag has to
 * be able to cross from the drawer onto the grid, out of a folder onto the grid, and out of an
 * item's menu onto the grid, and it can only do that while everything stays inside the home
 * screen's single gesture owner. Only the screens a drag never touches are destinations.
