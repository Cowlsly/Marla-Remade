/**
 * Decides what to do with saved items whose target may no longer be there.
 *
 * Run on cold start and on every package/profile event. The distinction that matters is
 * **uninstalled** versus **unavailable**: a work profile turned off, or an app on
 * unmounted storage, reports as gone but comes back. Deleting on unavailable is the
 * classic launcher bug where pausing a work profile permanently wipes half the home
 * screen, so those items are hidden and restored instead.
 *
 * Pure, and returns actions rather than performing them, so the whole matrix of
 * installed/unavailable/missing against already-hidden is unit-testable.
