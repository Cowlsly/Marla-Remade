/**
 * The UI contract between [LauncherViewModel] and the pages in `ui`.
 *
 * Pages take a state value plus an actions interface rather than the ViewModel itself, so
 * they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — which is what the store listing images are
 * generated from (see `src/screenshotTest`). It lives beside the ViewModel rather than in
 * `ui` so the dependency runs one way.
 *
 * Every actions method has a no-op default body, so `HomeActions.Noop` and friends are the
 * whole implementation a preview needs.
 *
 * Note what these models deliberately do *not* contain: no `UserHandle`, no `ShortcutInfo`,
 * no `AppWidgetProviderInfo`. Those cannot be constructed outside a real device, and a
 * state model that cannot be written as a literal cannot be previewed. Profiles are carried
 * as the `UserManager` serial number and resolved back in the ViewModel.
