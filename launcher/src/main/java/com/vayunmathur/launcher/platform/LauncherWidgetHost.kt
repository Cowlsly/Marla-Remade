/**
 * The `AppWidgetHost` for the launcher.
 *
 * The host id is frozen forever. It is the key the system files every allocated
 * `appWidgetId` under, so changing it orphans every widget the user has ever placed —
 * they would silently stop updating and could never be recovered. There is no migration
 * for this; it just has to never change.
 *
 * `startListening` / `stopListening` are bound to the Activity lifecycle rather than the
 * process: listening keeps `RemoteViews` flowing for every hosted widget, which is wasted
 * work and wasted battery while the home screen is not on screen. Both can throw on some
 * OEM builds when a provider misbehaves during the initial update, so both are guarded —
 * a widget that fails to start updating is much better than a launcher that cannot start.
