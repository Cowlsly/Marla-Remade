 * seeking is an offset rather than a key-frame renegotiation, pausing is the TV's business
 * entirely, and the phone neither decodes nor encodes a frame.
 *
 * The server belongs in `:cast` and not in the app being cast. `:sdk:cast` exists so that a
 * consumer owns no sockets and needs no network permission - `:music` has no `INTERNET`
 * permission at all - so the app supplies bytes through a [MediaResourceResolver] and this end
 * puts them on the wire.
 *
 * Everything that decides *what* to answer lives in `:cast:protocol`
 * ([MediaProxyExchange], [EphemeralTls]), where it can be tested without a TV. What is left here
 * is sockets, threads and lifecycle.
 *
 * **Single-use: an instance that has been [stop]ped cannot be started again**, because [stop]
 * cancels [scope] and a later [start] would bind a port and then accept nothing. Every session
 * builds a fresh one, so this is a property worth stating rather than a bug worth guarding.
