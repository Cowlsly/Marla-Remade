/**
 * Transparent trampoline that asks for screen-capture consent and hands the result to
 * [CastService].
 *
 * It exists because of a hard platform ordering constraint, not for style. On Android 14+:
 *
 *  1. `createScreenCaptureIntent()` needs an Activity to launch it and receive the result, so a
 *     Quick Settings tile can never obtain consent by itself.
 *  2. A `mediaProjection`-typed foreground service must already be in the foreground *before*
 *     `getMediaProjection()` is called, which is why the token is forwarded to the service rather
 *     than turned into a projection here.
 *  3. The consent token is **single-use**. It cannot be cached, so this runs afresh for every
 *     session - which is also why there is no boot receiver anywhere in this feature.
 *
 * **Not `android:noHistory`**, unlike a first guess would suggest for a trampoline. `noHistory`
 * finishes an activity as soon as it stops being visible, and launching the system consent dialog
 * does exactly that - the result callback would never arrive.
