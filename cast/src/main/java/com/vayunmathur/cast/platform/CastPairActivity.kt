/**
 * Takes the six digits for a route selected in Settings.
 *
 * A route row has no text field, so until now the pairing state was only answerable from the app's
 * own screen: Settings sat at CONNECTING while the thing it was waiting for was somewhere the user
 * had no reason to look. This is that same prompt, put over Settings by
 * [com.vayunmathur.cast.platform.remotedisplay.MaRemoteDisplayProvider].
 *
 * **It pairs nothing itself.** It calls [CastController.submitPairCode], the same entry point the
 * in-app card uses, so the device key is stored by the same path - and a later session with the same
 * TV pairs silently and never launches this at all.
 *
 * `MirrorConsentActivity` is the precedent for being started from a background context, and the same
 * `START_ACTIVITIES_FROM_BACKGROUND` grant is what allows it.
 *
 * State is read straight off [CastController] rather than through [CastViewModel], whose `uiState` is
 * a `stateIn` starting at an empty [CastUiState]: built from that, the first frame would carry no TV
 * name and would read as "not awaiting a code", which is the very condition this dismisses itself on.
