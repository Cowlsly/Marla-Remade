 * entitled to buffer several frames before emitting the first, which for mirroring shows up as a
 * screen that lags the phone by a visible fraction of a second for no reason.
 *
 * **Where the codec configuration comes from depends on the codec.** For H.265 it is in-band, at the
 * front of the first key frame, exactly as H.264's SPS/PPS were - the sender caches the codec-config
 * buffer and prepends it, so nothing has to be passed to [start]. AV1's sequence header is not
 * expressible that way: `MediaCodec` wants it as `csd-0` at configure time, which is *before* any frame
 * has arrived, so it comes over the control channel and is handed in here instead. A decoder handed a
 * key frame with neither produces nothing and says nothing, which is exactly the failure mode this
 * pairing exists to make impossible.
