/**
 * Plays app content the phone is serving, rather than decoding pixels it encoded.
 *
 * This is the other half of the change that removes the encoder from the phone. The TV fetches byte
 * ranges of the original media over HTTPS and hands them to its own decoder, so it owns the clock,
 * the buffer and the seeking - and every pathology of the RTP path stops applying rather than being
 * fixed. A pause is a pause. A seek is a byte offset. There is no picture-loss indicator because
 * there are no lost pictures to indicate.
 *
 * **Trust is the session's, not a PKI's.** The certificate fingerprint arrived over the control
 * channel, which the pairing already authenticated, so the player's data source trusts exactly that
 * one certificate. Nothing here is told to skip verification - the point of pinning is that it
 * verifies something stronger than a name.
 *
 * **This player is the truth about a served session**, which is what [snapshot] and [apply] are for.
 * The phone has no player running - it deliberately paused its own before the cast started - so it
 * neither knows where playback is nor could usefully be asked to move it. Everything the phone shows
 * and everything it commands passes through here.
