/**
 * The picture: one full-screen `SurfaceView` the decoder writes straight into.
 *
 * **The surface is deliberately not Compose, and the overlay deliberately is.** The surface is one
 * handle given to `MediaCodec`; routing it through `AndroidView` would put a recomposition path
 * between the decoder and the display for no benefit. The transport controls have the opposite
 * requirement - they are state-driven and change constantly - so they are a *second child* of the same
 * `FrameLayout`, a `ComposeView` above the surface. The decoder's path is untouched by this; only the
 * overlay recomposes.
 *
 * **Letterboxing is done here, and that is the point.** The old sender scaled the phone's portrait
 * screen into a 1920x1080 frame and sent mostly black pixels, because a Cast receiver answers
 * `scaling: "sender"` and will not pad for you. Owning the receiver means the phone can send its own
 * aspect ratio at full resolution and the TV pads it - so none of the encoded frame is wasted.
 *
 * **This is also the app's whole input surface.** [dispatchKeyEvent] handles the remote directly rather
 * than moving a focus ring between buttons, because a media overlay's D-pad presses are gestures -
 * left seeks, up is volume - and there is nothing to focus. Keys are only claimed while a phone is
 * actually reporting playback, so screen mirroring keeps the ordinary behaviour of every key.
 *
 * **A press while the controls are hidden wakes them rather than toggling playback.** See
 * [dispatchKeyEvent]; an audio-only session never has hidden controls at all, because there is no
 * picture for them to get out of the way of.

     * Two different sizes are set here and the distinction is the whole point:
     *
     *  - The **layout** size is the letterbox. A portrait phone appears as a tall strip in the middle
     *    of the panel, which is what mirroring a phone should look like.
     *  - The **buffer** size, via [SurfaceHolder.setFixedSize], stays at the sender's own
     *    resolution. Without it the surface buffer is the view's size, so a 1344x2992 frame was
     *    squeezed into roughly 486x1080 by `MediaCodec` before it ever reached the panel - the
     *    phone's extra resolution was encoded, transmitted, and then thrown away on arrival. With it
     *    the composer scales a full-resolution buffer to the output instead, and can put it on a
     *    hardware overlay rather than through the 1080p UI framebuffer.
     *
     * Whether that last step actually happens is the composer's decision, not ours, so it has to be
     * checked on the device with `dumpsys SurfaceFlinger` rather than assumed.
