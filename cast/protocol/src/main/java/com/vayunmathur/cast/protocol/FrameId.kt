/**
 * A frame's identifier.
 *
 * **Not an 8-bit wrapping value**, which is the trap here. openscreen's `FrameId`
 * (`cast/streaming/public/frame_id.h`) extends `ExpandedValueBase<int64_t>`: the counter is 64-bit
 * and only *truncated* to 8 bits for the RTP header, with the receiver re-expanding it. Modelling
 * Modelling
 * the counter itself as a byte would still produce correct headers but the wrong encryption IV
 * from frame 256 onward, because [Crypto] derives the IV from [lower32] of the full value.
 *
 * `first()` is 0 and `leader()` is -1 ("the frame before the first"), both verbatim from
 * openscreen; `leader` is what a key frame references, since it has no real predecessor.
