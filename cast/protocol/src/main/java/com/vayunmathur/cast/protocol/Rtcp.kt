 * RTCP, both directions.

 * is what makes a disagreement about the wire format a failing unit test instead of a black screen
 * on a TV across the room.
 *
 * The layouts come from openscreen `cast/streaming/impl/rtcp_common.cc` (the common header),
 * `impl/sender_report_builder.cc` (the sender report) and `impl/compound_rtcp_parser.cc`
 * (`ParseFeedback`, the ACK/NACK). The wire diagrams are in `impl/rtp_defines.h`.
 *
 * Getting this wrong does not look like an error: the picture renders and then freezes, because
 * without sender reports the receiver has no clock to schedule against, and without feedback
 * nothing is ever retransmitted.
