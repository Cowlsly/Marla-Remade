 * Most random patterns fail that test, which is why this loops. Rejection sampling is cheap here
 * because the check is line propagation over a grid of at most 15 — a handful of milliseconds — so a
 * few dozen attempts still finish fast enough to run on a background dispatcher while a spinner
 * shows. This is the opposite trade to `games/pipes`, whose win condition needs a full-board
 * uniqueness proof too slow to attempt on device.
