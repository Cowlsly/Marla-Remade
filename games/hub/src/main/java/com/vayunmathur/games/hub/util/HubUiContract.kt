/**
 * The UI contract between [com.vayunmathur.games.hub.viewmodel.GameHubViewModel] and the
 * three screens that the store listing is captured from.
 *
 * Those screens take a state value plus an actions interface rather than the ViewModel
 * itself, so they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — which is what the listing images are
 * generated from. It lives in `util` rather than `ui` so the dependency runs one way:
 * `ui` depends on `util`, never the reverse.
 *
 * The ViewModel exposes Room flows, not a single state object, so the `…Page` binders are
 * what collect the flows and assemble these values. Anything that needs a [android.content.Context]
 * — installed-package lookups, app icons, launching a game — is resolved there too, which
 * is what leaves the screens renderable with no device.
