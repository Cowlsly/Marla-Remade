 * Achievements in Voxels exist at two tiers.
 *
 * The **world** tier tracks one save, so a fresh world starts at zero and its counters mean what they
 * say. The **app** tier is "ever, in any world" — that's the one the Games Hub mirrors, and its keys
 * are unprefixed so it is byte-for-byte what every earlier build wrote.
 *
 * Nothing calls the two managers directly; [VoxelsAchievements] forwards to both so the ~30 call
 * sites in MainActivity stay one line each.
