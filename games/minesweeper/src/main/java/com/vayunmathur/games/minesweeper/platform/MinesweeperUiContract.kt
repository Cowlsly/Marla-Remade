/**
 * The UI contract between [MinesweeperViewModel] and the board.
 *
 * The board takes this interface rather than the ViewModel itself so it can be rendered by a
 * `@Preview` — which is what the store listing images are generated from. It lives in `platform`
 * rather than next to the board so the dependency runs one way: `ui` depends on `platform`, and the
 * ViewModel implements this.
 *
 * Every member has a no-op default, so [Noop] is the whole implementation a preview needs.
