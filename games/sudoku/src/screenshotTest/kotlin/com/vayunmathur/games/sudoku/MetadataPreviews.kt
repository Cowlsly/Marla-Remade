/**
 * The store listing images.
 *
 * Previews must be members of a class and carry both `@PreviewTest` and `@Preview`, or the
 * screenshot engine discovers no tests. The `PreviewN` names set the order they appear in the
 * listing, because the collector sorts by filename. Run `./gradlew :games:sudoku:metadata`.
 *
 * Boards come from [SudokuGenerator] with a fixed seed rather than 81 transcribed digits: the same
 * seed gives the same puzzle on any machine, so the images are reproducible from a clean checkout
 * and are guaranteed to be legal puzzles. [GameBoardScreen] has no polling `LaunchedEffect` — the
 * clock lives in the stateful `GameScreen` — so a preview settles on the first frame.
