 * Played/won/streak/best-time records, kept per board size and difficulty.

 * Records are keyed by variant rather than rolled into one number because a best time only means
 * something next to the shape it was set on — 90 seconds is a slow 4x4 and a remarkable 9x9. The
 * home screen still wants a single figure per size, so [getSizeStats] aggregates by key prefix
 * instead of keeping a second denormalised record that could drift.
 *
 * Reads are synchronous and happen during composition. That is fine for SharedPreferences, which is
 * an in-memory map after the first load, and is the reason this is not a DataStore.
