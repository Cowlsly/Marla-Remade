/**
 * The digit keys, laid out as a grid in the board's own box shape.
 *
 * Reusing [SudokuGameState.size]'s box geometry means the pad is a miniature of a box — 2x3 for 6x6,
 * 3x3 for 9x9, 3x4 for 12x12 — so a digit sits in the same relative position on the pad as it does in
 * the pencil marks.
 *
 * Keys are fixed-size squares packed flush against each other rather than stretched across the width: a
 * full-width grid would give keys around 90dp across on a 12x12, which crowds out the board.
 *
 * They are drawn like the grid's own cells — background-coloured inside, outlined — rather than as
 * filled buttons, so a block of ten of them does not dominate the screen above the board it serves.
 *
 * No key is ever disabled. A wrong digit is accepted silently, so there is nothing to gate on, and a
 * digit that already appears the maximum number of times may still be one the player wants to move.
