 * The UI contract between [WordMakerViewModel] and the screens.
 *
 * Screens take a state value plus an actions interface rather than the ViewModel itself,
 * so they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — which is what the store listing images are
 * generated from. It lives in `util` alongside the ViewModel so the dependency runs one way:
 * the screens depend on this contract, and the ViewModel implements it.
