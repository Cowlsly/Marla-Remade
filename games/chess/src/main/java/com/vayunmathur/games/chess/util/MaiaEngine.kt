/**
 * How strong the AI plays, as a rating the model is asked to imitate.
 *
 * Maia3 takes strength as an **input** rather than as a search handicap, so these are Elo
 * ratings and not depth or skill settings. A level plays like a human of that rating: it makes
 * the mistakes that rating makes, rather than playing well and then discarding a move.
 *
 * Ratings are from Lichess blitz, which is what the model was trained on. `GRANDMASTER` at 2500
 * is near the top of that distribution; asking for much more extrapolates past what the model
 * has seen rather than getting stronger.
 *
 * Sampling is deliberately not argmax — the upstream `maia3-5m` launcher runs at temperature 0,
 * which plays the identical game from the identical position every time. A little temperature
 * with nucleus sampling keeps the strength while varying the game, and it narrows as the level
 * rises because a stronger player has fewer moves worth considering.
 *
 * **Four entries in ascending order**, and that is a contract with two places:
 * `MainActivity`'s picker zips them positionally against four localized labels, and its
 * `win_vs_ai_hard` achievement gate compares ordinals against [ADVANCED].
 *
 * Declared here as a top-level enum rather than inside [MaiaEngine] on purpose: the store
 * listing screenshots render `NewGameDialog`, which reads [entries], on a JVM with no device.
 * Reaching it must not pull in a class whose initialiser loads a `.so`.

/**
 * The chess AI: Maia3-5M on `:library:ml`'s Vulkan runtime.
 *
 * One forward pass per move and no search. It replaces Stockfish, which was an 86 MB NNUE and a
 * depth-8 tree behind a JitPack AAR driven over UCI text through two channels; none of that
 * survives, including the UCI, which was only ever Stockfish's transport.
 *
 * # What a move costs
 *
 * Encode the board to 12 planes, one inference, mask 4352 logits to the legal moves, sample.
 * The mask is what makes the model safe to use: it scores every from-to pair on the board,
 * including the ~4000 that are not moves, so the legal list is not an optimisation.
 *
 * # Black is mirrored
 *
 * The model only ever sees a position from the mover's side: when black is to move the board is
 * flipped vertically and the colours are swapped. That is also why the vocabulary has no black
 * promotions at all — every promotion is rank 7 to rank 8. [moveIndex] does the flip in one
 * place, for both squares of a move, so encoding and scoring cannot disagree about it.
 *
 * # The lock
 *
 * [MaiaHandle] is not thread-safe, so the mutex covers the whole of [bestMove] and the lazy
 * load inside it. Modelled on `NllbTranslator`, including [close] being non-suspending because
 * its only caller is `ViewModel.onCleared`.
