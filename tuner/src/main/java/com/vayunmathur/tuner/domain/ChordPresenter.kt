/**
 * Decides what the Chord tab shows, given the detector's per-frame readings (TUNER_SPEC I.7).
 *
 * Separate from the detector because it answers a different question. The detector answers
 * "what is sounding in this 786 ms window", which is a measurement and is allowed to change
 * every frame. This answers "what should the user be looking at", which is a UI question and
 * must not.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, in opposite directions:
 *
 * - [HYSTERESIS_FRAMES] slows a *new* name down, so a reading passing through on the way to
 *   another one does not appear.
 * - [PresentationHold] slows *clearing* down, which is the one that was missing. Measured on a
 *   real ukulele: a strum produced 35 separate visible episodes, 16 of them one or two frames
 *   long, because the tonality gate drops in and out through the decay and the display followed
 *   it frame for frame. A tuner that strobes is unusable, so the display stops tracking the
 *   gate.
 *
 * The Note tab uses [PresentationHold] directly, without the hysteresis: a new *note* must
 * appear immediately, because a held reading over a genuine change would have the user tuning
 * against a note they are no longer playing.
