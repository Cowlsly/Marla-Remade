/**
 * Whether a CQT frame contains tonal content at all - the gate the Chord tab needs and the Note
 * tab gets for free.
 *
 * YIN computes an aperiodicity measure as part of finding a period, so the Note tab rejects
 * background noise using a number the algorithm already had. NNLS has no equivalent: it is a
 * fitting procedure, so given room hum it returns the non-negative combination of dictionary
 * atoms that best explains room hum, and the namer downstream has no way to tell that from a
 * chord. Nothing in the deconvolution pipeline ever asks whether the input was music.
 *
 * This asks. Two signals do the work - the flatness of the CQT frame, and an absolute floor
 * under the strongest salience - and both are read off stages that have already run, so the
 * gate costs one pass over 180 bins and no extra transform. A third, the NNLS residual, is
 * measured alongside them and deliberately not used: see [Tonality.explained].

     * Fraction of the observation's energy the fitted dictionary accounts for.

     * Measured but deliberately **not** gated on, which is worth recording because the argument
     * for using it is a good one and someone will make it again. Residual energy is the
     * principled choice: it asks directly whether a *harmonic* model explains the input rather
     * than asking after a correlate of that.
     *
     * It does not work here. Over the tier-A corpus under four partial laws, real chords explain
     * 0.741..0.951 of the frame and white and pink noise explain 0.499..0.727. Those
     * distributions are 0.014 apart and no threshold separates them: gating at 0.75 rejects
     * three of the fourteen tier-A voicings on a fast-decaying partial law, and every threshold
     * low enough to keep them also passes every noise frame tested.
     *
     * The reason is that the dictionary is expressive enough to absorb noise. Sixty non-negative
     * columns over 180 bins, each a comb of twelve Gaussians, can between them account for most
     * of any positive spectrum - the same property that makes the deconvolution work. So the
     * residual measures how flexible the dictionary is at least as much as how harmonic the
     * input was. TonalityTest asserts the overlap so this cannot be reinstated unnoticed.
