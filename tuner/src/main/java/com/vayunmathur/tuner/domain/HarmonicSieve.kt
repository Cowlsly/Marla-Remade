/**
 * The Chord tab's note extractor: FFT, score only the pitches the instrument can sound, take the
 * strongest, subtract its measured partials, repeat.
 *
 * This replaced NNLS as the primary extractor on measured evidence, not on preference. The
 * argument for the deconvolution is that a note's overtone series is itself a chord, so a plain
 * chromagram of one low C already looks like C7 and something has to undo that. The measurement
 * (`RealAudioHarness` against Record-3, a real ukulele) is that on this instrument the series is
 * 1.00, 0.18, 0.07 and then noise - so the ambiguity the deconvolution exists to resolve is
 * mostly not present, and a greedy sieve over a closed set of candidate pitches does better:
 *
 * ```
 *                                 frames named   named correctly   notes / tonal frame
 * NNLS, 1/n dictionary             2 (1.4%)       1 (0.7%)          1.89
 * NNLS, measured partials          7 (4.8%)       6 (4.1%)          2.34
 * this, six picks                 13 (9.0%)      11 (7.6%)          3.39
 * this, picks = string count      16 (11.0%)     14 (9.7%)          2.80
 * ```
 *
 * Read those with care: **notes per frame is the wrong denominator** and reading it as progress
 * is a mistake this file used to make. `ChordNaming` scores *distinct pitch classes*, and on a
 * re-entrant ukulele C4 and C5 are two notes and one pitch class - so "3.39 notes is essentially
 * a full triad" was never a valid inference, and indeed the best row here has *fewer* notes per
 * frame than the row above it. Measured in pitch classes, six picks on a four-string instrument
 * produced 5 or 6 distinct classes on 13 of 46 tonal frames, which a ukulele cannot physically
 * sound: the extra classes are residue the partial subtraction did not remove, and each one
 * costs `EXTRA_TONE_PENALTY` at the scorer. Capping picks at the instrument's string count
 * removes every 5pc and 6pc frame and names three more.
 *
 * The cap comes from `Instrument.polyphony`, not from a swept constant. Sweeping picks over
 * 3..6 against Record-3 puts the optimum at exactly 4 - the ukulele's string count - which is
 * the instrument model already knowing the answer rather than a number that was tuned.
 *
 * [RELATIVE_FLOOR] was swept over 0.04..0.30 at the same time and, once picks are capped, moves
 * frames between `SingleNote` and `Interval` without changing frames-named at all. It is not
 * where the remaining loss is.
 *
 * The 17 frames still yielding a single pitch class are quiet ones: bucketing frame RMS by
 * pitch-class count on Record-3 gives a median of -24.3 dBFS at 1pc against -14.9 at 5pc, with
 * no overlap at all between the two - every 1pc frame is quieter than every 5pc frame. They are
 * decay tails, and lowering the floor into them produces intervals rather than triads, which is
 * what the sweep shows. Whatever recovers them is not a threshold on this frame.
 *
 * `ChordAccuracyTest` says the opposite of all of this and is not evidence: its corpus is
 * generated from the same harmonic model the NNLS dictionary assumes, so it measures whether
 * the solver can invert a spectrum it effectively constructed. It is a regression guard, and
 * it keeps the uncapped default so that it stays one.
 *
 * Why a *closed candidate set* matters as much as the sieve: scoring only the notes the chosen
 * instrument can physically sound removes the octave-below phantom outright. A hypothesis one
 * octave under a real note explains that note's fundamental with its own second partial, and on
 * a ukulele - lowest note C4 - a phantom C3 eats the G of a C chord while never showing up as a
 * spurious tone, because it shares the root's pitch class.
 *
 * Not thread-safe and not stateless across instruments: call [setInstrument] rather than
 * rebuilding, and drive it from one analysis coroutine.
