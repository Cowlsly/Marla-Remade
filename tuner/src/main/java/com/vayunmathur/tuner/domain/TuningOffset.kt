/**
 * How far the instrument being heard sits from equal temperament, in cents.
 *
 * [HarmonicSieve] scores at exact semitone centres, so an instrument that is a long way flat has
 * every fundamental between the frequencies the sieve looks at and scores badly for a reason
 * that is not its fault. Record-3 is 56.9 cents flat and is the case that motivated this: with
 * no compensation the true peaks fall outside the sieve's search window entirely.
 *
 * Method: parabolic interpolation of every strong local maximum in the CQT, then the circular
 * mean deviation from the nearest semitone, accumulated over frames. Circular because the
 * quantity wraps, and accumulated because one frame of one plucked note is a sample of one.

     * fraction of a semitone is measurable: peaks 43 cents above the nearest semitone and peaks
     * 57 cents below the next one up are the same spectrum, and nothing in the audio
     * distinguishes them. Nearest-semitone would call Record-3 B major; the player was playing C
     * on an instrument nobody had tuned.
     *
     * So the tie is broken by a prior about instruments rather than by the signal: strings relax
     * and go flat, they do not go sharp on their own. An apparent sharpness beyond
     * [MAX_SHARP_CENTS] is read as the flat branch instead. Below that a genuinely slightly-sharp
     * instrument is taken at face value, because folding *everything* to flat would put a
     * freshly-tuned instrument a semitone out.
     *
     * This is the one number here that is a choice and not a measurement, and it is a choice
     * about which whole semitone the answer lands in - so getting it wrong renames every chord
     * by a semitone rather than degrading gracefully.
