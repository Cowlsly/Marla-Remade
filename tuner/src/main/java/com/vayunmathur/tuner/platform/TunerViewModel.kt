/**
 * Owns the microphone, the pitch analyser and the state the Note tab renders.
 *
 * Capture is user-initiated and never implicit, but the intent outlives the microphone: leaving
 * the foreground releases the device (a tuner has no business holding a microphone open in the
 * background) while remembering that the user had it on, and coming back reopens it. Both halves
 * matter. Without the visible control the user has no way in at all; without the resume the
 * microphone dies on every interruption - a notification, the permission dialog - and the user
 * has to keep pressing start between adjustments.
 *
 * Both tabs share one microphone and one coroutine. The chord pipeline is an order of magnitude
 * more expensive than the pitch one - a five-octave CQT against a 128 ms window - so it runs
 * once every [CHORD_EVERY] pitch hops rather than on every frame.
