/**
 * The Chord tab against a strum shaped like a real one, rather than a sustained tone.
 *
 * This covers a bug reported from real use on a ukulele: a chord appeared for about 50 ms and
 * vanished, over and over. Nothing in the existing corpus could have caught it, because every
 * signal in it is sustained, noiseless and constant for the whole window - so the tonality gate
 * either passes for all of it or none of it, and a display that tracks the gate frame by frame
 * looks perfectly stable.
 *
 * What the device actually produces (966 frames, real ukulele, Pixel 8):
 *
 * - real strums measure **0.14..0.38** spectral flatness against a gate at 0.40, where the
 *   synthetic corpus that placed the gate measured **0.004..0.142**. The design margin of 0.258
 *   is really 0.018.
 * - real chord frames and real rejected frames **overlap** across 0.20..0.40. On the synthetic
 *   corpus they were 0.567 apart. Flatness does not separate the two on real input, so no
 *   threshold fixes this.
 * - the gate therefore drops in and out through a decay, producing 35 visible episodes with a
 *   mean length of 3.26 frames and 16 of them one or two frames long.
 *
 * So the assertion here is not "the gate never drops out" - it does, and re-tuning it cannot
 * stop it. It is that the *presentation* survives the dropouts.
