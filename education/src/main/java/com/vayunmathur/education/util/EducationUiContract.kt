/**
 * The UI contract between [EducationViewModel] plus the back stack and the handful of
 * screens the store listing is captured from.
 *
 * Those screens take a state value and an actions interface rather than the ViewModel, so
 * they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — see `src/screenshotTest`, which is where the
 * listing images come from. There is no content pack, no database and no narrator there,
 * which is exactly what makes the images reproducible from a clean checkout.
 *
 * Only the catalog, a course, and the two quiz shells are split this way. Every other
 * screen still takes the ViewModel directly; splitting all eighteen of them would be a
 * large change for no benefit.
 *
 * It lives in `util` rather than `ui` so the dependency runs one way: `ui` depends on
 * `util`, and the ViewModel never depends on the screens.
